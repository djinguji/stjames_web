world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more

		Dear Friends,<p>At the hospitality next Sunday, February 14,
following the 10 o’clock Mass you will have an
opportunity to greet John Simpson and to
thank him for his years of ministry here at St.
James. I know John looks forward to seeing as
many of you as possible. I sincerely regret that
since I will be away for my annual retreat at

you and John in spirit.</p>
<p>Once again, let me take this opportunity to
express in my sincere gratitude to John for his
caring and highly effective ministry among us
