<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I want to share some more staffing changes with you as we approach the
summer months. Like all announcements of this sort, this is a ‘bad news/good news’
story.</p>
<p><b>Joe Cotton</b>, our youth minister for the past three years will be a taking a new
position at the archdiocese that will involve him in oversight of criminal justice
ministry, immigration ministry, and King County juvenile detention ministry.
Happily, Joe, in his years with us, has succeeded in building a really strong youth
ministry program—the envy of the archdiocese in terms of its involving young people
in social justice and social outreach—and this gives me confidence that our youth
ministry program will continue to flourish under a new director with the ongoing
commitment of the adult leadership team. And even though I hate to see Joe leave us,
it’s reassuring to know that he is going to continue to serve here on the adult
leadership team. As he prepares to take leave of us, I want to take this opportunity to
thank Joe for the amazing work he has done in building an outstanding youth
ministry program from the ground up. Joe is not only a pied piper, he is a deeply
committed minister of the gospel who has inspired our young people by his spark and
spirit and made them excited about their faith. I would say that the Archdiocese has
shown remarkably good judgment in hiring him!</p>
<p><b>Tom Frasene</b>, who promised to give us two years of service when he joined the
staff two years ago has kept his promise and, in terms of what he has accomplished,
more than kept it! Tom has very effectively coordinated a huge army of volunteers in
a number of our social outreach ministries. In addition, he has headed up and
expanded our parish’s wonderful young adult ministry as well as the Sunday
hospitality ministry. In each of these areas Tom has made his mark, and for this I want
to express my deepest thanks. Tom has been accepted in the School of Social Work at
the University of Washington (no small achievement!) and I know you will join me in
wishing him well as he takes this next important step in his career. Knowing Tom,
that career will always involve serving the poor and advocating on their behalf as he
has done so well here at St. James.</p>
<p>Stepping into Joe’s and Tom’s shoes is our own parishioner, <b>Curtis Leighton</b>,
who has been teaching theology at Bishop Blanchet High School this past year. Curtis
is a graduate of Bishop Blanchet and a graduate, in 2001, of our own RCIA program.
Following high school, Curtis went to the University of Notre Dame. After teaching in
California for two years with the Teach for America program, he joined the Society of
Jesus. A lover of languages and cultures, Curtis was able to minister in places such as
Colombia, China, and Lebanon. After earning a degree in Philosophy at Loyola
University Chicago, he returned to Washington where he ministered at Gonzaga
University and St. Aloysius parish in Spokane. After a year and a half working there,
he decided to leave the Jesuits and return home to Seattle to begin teaching at
Blanchet. Knowing Curtis as I do, I am confident that he will bring wonderful
leadership to two different Cathedral ministries: the youth ministry and the ministry
to young adults. He is excited to be joining us and I know he will inspire excitement
among our teenagers and young adults.</p>
<p>Please join me in thanking Joe Cotton and Tom Frasene and in welcoming
Curtis Leighton!</p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A young man
called the SVdP Helpline (206-767-6449) needing rent help because his wallet had 
been stolen. When our two Vincentians visited, he seemed very downcast. We gave 
him a rent voucher. Usually when we help with rent, it lifts spirits. But he 
still seemed depressed. We asked, “Is there anything else we can help you with?” 
He said, “Like what?” We said, “Prayer?” He said, “Yes!” The three of us prayed 
together, and we could see and feel joy return to his life. Thank you for your 
financial support, which helps make uplifting visits like this possible. Would 
you like to be a home visitor? <i>Information</i>,
