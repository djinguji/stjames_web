<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our <b>Sunday Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>
<p><b>COVER ART</b> St. Lawrence with palm. Virgin and Child
with Six Saints (detail). Neri di Bicci, ca. 1456.</p>
<p><b>YEAR OF MERCY</b>. We welcome all pilgrims to St. James
Cathedral during this Year of Mercy. Whether you are a
visitor or a regular at St. James, you can walk through
the Holy Doors of Mercy, the four bronze doors at the
Cathedral’s west entrance. The center doors are opened
before and after each Mass. A self-guided pilgrimage of
prayer, <i>The Way of Mercy</i>, is available as well—pick up a flyer just 
inside the Holy Doors. The banner at the ministers’
pier, by fabric artist Juanita Yoder, was commissioned
for the Year of Mercy. It suggests the overflowing streams of God’s
mercy.</p>
<p><b>CHILDREN’S PROCESSION OF PALMS</b> at the beginning
of the Noon Mass. Meet in the West Vestibule at
11:50am. Parents, please accompany very young
