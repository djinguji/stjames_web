<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our <b>Sunday Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

	<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
woman partially disabled 40 years ago by a drunk
driver. She now has a life-threatening disease. Unable
to work the last few years, she depends on Social
Security Disability Insurance for income. Recently
Social Security cut off her payments and demanded
she return over $75,000. She called the SVdP Helpline (206-767-6449). When we 
visited, she looked ill and scared. We gave rent help and referred her to pro 
bono attorneys who (donating their time) might help her appeal the Social 
Security decision and to a state program for possible income during the appeal. 
She had not known about such help and was grateful for this ray of hope. Your 
support made that possible – thank you! <i>Information</i>,
