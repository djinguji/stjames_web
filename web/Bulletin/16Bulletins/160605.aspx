	<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a middle-aged man at his 
	wit’s end over his electricity bill. His monthly usage was less than $40, 
	and he always paid slightly more than that. But, he said, the balance due 
	kept rising. “See? I owe them over $220 now! That means I’m more than 5 
	months behind! How can that be?” We looked at the bill. It showed a “credit 
	balance” of $220. He had been overpaying (for a long time) and owed nothing. 
	But he did not understand what a “credit balance” is and, thanks to a life 
	lived in poverty, the idea of being “ahead” on his bill never occurred to 
	him. We were all smiling as this conscientious man realized he could take a 
	vacation from paying his bill! Your support makes our visits possible—would 
	you like to join us? <i>Information</i>,
