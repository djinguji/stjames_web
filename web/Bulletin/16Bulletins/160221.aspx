<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our <b>Sunday Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

<p><b>YEAR OF MERCY</b>. We welcome all pilgrims to St. James
Cathedral during this Year of Mercy. Whether you are a
visitor or a regular at St. James, you can walk through
the Holy Doors of Mercy, the four bronze doors at the
Cathedral’s west entrance. The center doors are opened
before and after each Mass. A self-guided pilgrimage of
prayer, <i>The Way of Mercy</i>, is available as well—pick up a flyer just 
inside the Holy Doors. The banner at the ministers’
pier, by fabric artist Juanita Yoder, was commissioned
for the Year of Mercy. It suggests the overflowing
streams of mercy which God pours out on us, and which
we are invited to experience more deeply in the Year of
Mercy.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. After every Mass
this weekend, the ushers will accept your donations to SVdP. After the 10:00am Sunday mass this weekend,
Cathedral Vincentians will stand alongside the ushers
as a visible sign of our deep gratitude to all of you–whether you donate to SVdP or simply say an
occasional prayer for us and for those we seek to help.
Our SVdP group at St James could not exist without your loyal support. Thank 
you!

<p><b>ART EXHIBIT: IMPRINT OF MERCY BY TRUNG PHAM,
SJ</b>. During this Lent of the Year of Mercy, we are
pleased to welcome to the Chapel a series of paintings
by Father Trung Pham, SJ, Assistant Professor of Art
and Art History at Seattle University. These paintings
invite us to meditate on wounds—Christ’s wounds and
ours. Father Pham writes: “Pope Francis affirms that
the name of God is Mercy. The deepest way one can
experience mercy fully is to keep in touch with one’s
own wounds and the wounds of others. The Imprint of
Mercy series will help viewers to meditate upon the
meaning of mercy and experience the power of
vulnerability through the arts.” Father Pham will give
a brief talk on the series on Sunday, February 28
immediately following the 10:00am Mass.</p>
