<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>It is a joy to welcome you to St. James Cathedral on this Easter of 2016. I do so in the name
of our Archbishop, J. Peter Sartain, as well as in my own.</p>
<p>Of all the times we gather as Christian believers, none is more important than Easter — the
greatest of all our feasts. Easter celebrates the Mystery that is the very foundation of our Christian
faith, for, as St. Paul wrote, “If Christ has not risen, our faith is in vain” (1 Cor. 15:14). But Christ
has risen and your presence here in the Cathedral today both affirms and celebrates that most
amazing and enduring of all realities! While we do not see him, we know he lives and we know
that he is in our midst breathing life and hope into us, walking alongside us on our pilgrimage of
faith, our journey toward the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing what is in your heart as you come here on this Easter Sunday. For
some, I am sure, there is joy and a keen sense of hope for the future as Spring with its
promise of new life is bursting forth all around us. For others, there may be the burden of pain
and sadness that comes from a serious illness, a family crisis, the death of a loved one, or the loss of
a job. For still others, this may be the Easter that you have decided to get more serious and
intentional about the practice of your Catholic faith—or at least to explore that possibility.
If so, good for you! What better year for that than this Jubilee Year of Mercy proclaimed by Pope
Francis!</p>
<p>Whatever your situation, it is my prayer that Easter of 2016 will bring you gifts of joy and
peace and a renewal of your faith in Christ risen.</p>
<p>And whether you have come here today in joy or sadness, hope or uncertainty, I want you to
know how welcome you are. And I hope that you will find here at St. James Cathedral something
that will comfort you, challenge you, and lift you up. We live in a world that, while incredibly
beautiful, is also seriously flawed. Death and life are never very far away from us, are they? But
Easter boldly proclaims that death is not the end of the story. Easter proclaims for all to hear that
Life will get the last word, not death!</p>
<p>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, please know that we warmly welcome you and hope that
you will return soon – maybe even to become part of this amazing and vibrant community of
faith. The doors are open! And if you are already part of the parish family of St. James, I take this
opportunity to thank you for all the ways in which you make the Risen Lord Jesus present in this
parish and in this city day after day: through your prayer, your faith, and your love that overflow
in unselfish service to the poor and in generous advocacy on their behalf.</p>
<p>May the blessings of the Risen Lord Jesus be yours in abundance!</p>
