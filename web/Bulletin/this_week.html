<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our <b>Sunday Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

<p><b>YEAR OF MERCY</b>. We welcome all pilgrims to St. James
Cathedral during this Year of Mercy. Whether you are a
visitor or a regular at St. James, you can walk through
the Holy Doors of Mercy, the four bronze doors at the
Cathedral’s west entrance. The center doors are opened
before and after each Mass. A self-guided pilgrimage of
prayer, <i>The Way of Mercy</i>, is available as well—pick up a flyer just 
inside the Holy Doors. The banner at the ministers’
pier, by fabric artist Juanita Yoder, was commissioned
for the Year of Mercy. It suggests the overflowing
streams of mercy which God pours out on us, and which
we are invited to experience more deeply in the Year of
Mercy.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. After every Mass
this weekend, the ushers will accept your donations to SVdP. After the 10:00am Sunday mass this weekend,
Cathedral Vincentians will stand alongside the ushers
as a visible sign of our deep gratitude to all of you–whether you donate to SVdP or simply say an
occasional prayer for us and for those we seek to help.
Our SVdP group at St James could not exist without your loyal support. Thank 
you!

<p><b>ART EXHIBIT: IMPRINT OF MERCY BY TRUNG PHAM,
SJ</b>. During this Lent of the Year of Mercy, we are
pleased to welcome to the Chapel a series of paintings
by Father Trung Pham, SJ, Assistant Professor of Art
and Art History at Seattle University. These paintings
invite us to meditate on wounds—Christ’s wounds and
ours. Father Pham writes: “Pope Francis affirms that
the name of God is Mercy. The deepest way one can
experience mercy fully is to keep in touch with one’s
own wounds and the wounds of others. The Imprint of
Mercy series will help viewers to meditate upon the
meaning of mercy and experience the power of
vulnerability through the arts.” Father Pham will give
a brief talk on the series on Sunday, February 28
immediately following the 10:00am Mass.</p>

least once or twice a year, this story repeats itself: We
visit a kind-hearted woman (or man) who asks for a
comfortable chair (or bed or small loveseat) because
there is none in the apartment. We arrange delivery. A
year or so later, we visit again, do not see the furniture
and are told, “I gave it to someone else who needed it
more than me.” Won’t you join us in this grace-filled
ministry to the poor in our parish? Please stop by the SVdP table at the Ministries Fair today to learn more
about what Vincentians do and how we put your dollars
to work to help our neighbors in need!</p>

marriage relationship. Your children and parish will be
thankful for your example of greater love and joy.
Experience the joy of a weekend at the Sheraton

<p>Each November our bulletin covers feature
the names of parishioners and friends who
over the past twenty-five years remembered
St. James Cathedral in their will. Each of those
names is a person, of course, and each person
had a story, and each story, in one way or
another, involved St. James Cathedral!</p>
<p>Some of their legacy gifts were large; others
were the proverbial widow’s mite; still others
were somewhere in the middle. But each gift
made a difference: each gift helped to keep the
Cathedral afloat – helped us fulfill our mission
– over these many years.</p>
<p>Every November, I take time to read those
names with care and as I do, I see familiar
faces and call to mind wonderful stories. And
I pray for each of those generous people,
giving thanks to God for them. I hope you
will do the same. We wouldn’t be what we
are without them!</p>

immigration system, an exploding political debate, and
a deadlock on reform in Washington, it was religious
leaders who rallied to form a humanitarian response to
the surge of unaccompanied children crossing the
border to the United States this summer.” Read more at

		Michaels</b> back to our pastoral team. Some of you will remember her 
		fondly from the years she ministered here with us (1995-2006). She 
		rejoins the staff now to head up our Adult Confirmation program as well 
		as our program for “returning Catholics” (Welcome Back!). In addition, 
		Rosanne will work with Suzanne Lee in various aspects of Family 
		Ministry, including baptismal preparation. And, given Rosanne’s wide 
		scope of interests, I suspect she will be making her mark in other areas 
		of parish life, too! Please join me in welcoming Rosanne Michaels back

that you were your usual generous selves in
responding to the collection last weekend in
support of the victims of the terrible landslide
in Snohomish County. To date, you have
contributed $14,010! I know this will make a

<p align="center"><b>A SPECIAL NOTE FROM FATHER RYAN</b></p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
	<p>The Super Bowl was great for Seattle but
maybe not quite so great for St. James. Put it
this way: as far as attendance is concerned (we
were down about one-half), it was not such a
Super Sunday for St. James! And the
unexpected snow storm last weekend was a
repeat performance. It’s all very
understandable, of course but, as you know,
parish expenses continue, Super Bowls or
snowstorms notwithstanding! So, please take
this as a gentle reminder to catch up with your
contributions if you happened to miss either of
those weekends. Thank you!</p>

    Elect are now entering their final week of preparation for the Easter Vigil, where they
    will be baptized, confirmed and receive Eucharist for the first time as one with us in the
    faith. They will participate with us in our Holy Week liturgies, being dismissed for the
    last time on Holy Thursday evening. They will also participate in a daylong retreat on
    Holy Saturday in their final preparation rites prior to the celebration of the Vigil of
    all vigils! You are encouraged to join us at the Easter Vigil to celebrate this most
    important day of their lives where we, the baptized, will also renew our baptismal
    promises as we celebrate the resurrection of our Lord.</p>
    <p><b>PRAYER CARDS FOR THE ELECT</b>. Thank you for keeping our Elect in your prayers
    during this season of Lent. Now is the time to turn in your <i>personalized</i> cards or

    its regular hours. <i><b>They need to be turned in no later than Good Friday evening</b></i>.
