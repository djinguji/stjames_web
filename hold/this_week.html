<p><b>WELCOME</b>: If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how welcome
you are – whether you have come from another
part of the country, from across the world, or simply from
another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to
the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate
the Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We
are also able to offer a wide range of services to needy
people living in the central district of our city.</p>
<p><b>IN MEMORIAM</b>. The new violet vestment worn on this Laetare Sunday is the gift of the family and friends of
parishioner Paul Fritzler, who died in May, 2008. May
he rest in peace.</p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. Stop by the Cathedral
Bookstore today for a wide variety of Lenten reading,
including a wonderful new Lenten book by Timothy
Radcliffe, OP, <i>Why Go to Church</i>. Father Radcliffe
preached the Seven Last Words at St. James in 2003.</p>
<p><b>THE ANNUAL CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES
COLLECTION</b> is an important source of funding for the
Church’s efforts to provide relief and development
overseas, to welcome and care for migrants and
refugees, and to work on policies that promote justice
and peace. Envelopes for this important collection are
available in the pews this weekend.</p>
<p><b>NEW ON THE WEBSITE</b>. Log on to the website to read
(or listen to) Father Ryan’s homily of last Sunday.
Find out about coming events, pray the Stations of the
Cross online, download our Holy Week and Easter
Schedule, and much more! There are also lots of fun
features specifically designed for kids. Make www.stjames-cathedral.org your homepage!</p>

<p><b>OPERATION RICE BOWL</b> calls us to walk
in solidarity with our brothers and sisters
in need. During this fourth week of Lent,
we focus on Honduras, where Operation
Rice Bowl helps to support water
projects providing clean drinking water.
Catholic Relief Services also supports the Country
School for Small Farmers, providing skills training to
improve farming operations, and learning how to
participate in Fair Trade programs. Let us accept
the challenge of Operation Rice Bowl: to pray that
we overcome indifference to the needs of others; to
fast in solidarity with those who are hungry by eating
simply; to learn about the needs of the poor, and to
give money saved by fasting and eating simply to
Operation Rice Bowl.</p>

<p><b>FOUNDATIONS IN OUR CATHOLIC FAITH: <i>THE
GOSPELS OF MATTHEW AND MARK</i></b>. TODAY, Sunday,
March 22, 1:30-5:30 PM at St. Peter’s Parish Hall. In
this course, participants learn the concept of Synoptic
Gospels and their sources. They will explore the themes

and historical contexts for both Gospels. They will
discuss Jesus' Parables and explain what messages can
be gleaned for the modern believer. Please bring your
Bible and copy of the Catechism to the class. This
program is a wonderful opportunity to continue to grow
as mature and well-informed Catholics. (Co-sponsored

Romans--the most compelling and challenging of all his

</font>
<font face=Papyrus size=5>

E</font><font face=Papyrus size=4>LECT</p>
</font>
<font face=verdana size=-1>

<p>This week we celebrate the
second of the three Scrutinies
with the retelling of the story of
the man born blind. This Gospel
challenges our Elect to reflect
more deeply upon their lives,
with particular focus on the
“blind spots” that prevent them
from even seeing the effects of sin and evil in their
lives and in the lives of others. Later this week, the
Elect will be presented with our Creed. The Church
“lovingly entrust to them…this ancient text that has
always been regarded as expressing the heart of the
Church’s faith and prayer.” The Creed is presented
in order to enlighten the Elect and it recalls the
wonderful deeds of God for the salvation of the
human race. The Elect are to commit the Creed to
memory and will recite it publicly on Holy
Saturday. Continue to enter into these solemn rites
in prayer with our Elect as they prepare for baptism,
Eucharist and confirmation, and to pray for them
every day, for your prayers do make a difference!</p>

<p><b>FINDING WORK… WITH GOD’S HELP!</b> Our parish is
offering a series on the art of looking for work that is
grounded in prayer and community. Whether you’re
recently unemployed or just thinking of making a
switch, these sessions will help refine your job search
strategy and outline concrete steps you can take to
improve your visibility in the market. They will take
place on Tuesdays, March 24 and 31 from 7:00-9:00
PM in Cathedral Place, second floor. <i><b>This Week’s
Topic</b>: Interviewing Techniques—Part 1</i>. <i>Information</i>,

<p><i>During the Year of St. Paul, watch this space in the
bulletin for reflection questions that will lead us
deeper into the writings and example of St. Paul. You
are also invited to visit the Place of Prayer in the west
aisle and on the website</i>.</p>
<p>Today’s readings are all about light and darkness.
What does it mean to live “as children of the light”
in our world today?</p>
<p>“You were once darkness, but now you are light.”
How have Paul’s words come to life in your own
experience? During this Lenten season, we can see
them coming to life in our Elect, adults preparing
for baptism at the Easter Vigil. Have you
“adopted” one of our Elect to pray for each day
until Easter? If not, pick up a prayer card today!</p>

<p><b>RCIA SPONSOR INFORMATION MEETING</b>. Wednesday,

<p><b>CATHEDRAL KITCHEN</b>. Last week we celebrated
Marjorie’s 85th birthday. Marjorie has been coming as
a guest at the Kitchen for more than ten years. We had
a beautiful homemade cake—donated by a volunteer—embellished with candles, and made it a real party with
sparkling cider. Marjorie’s comment: “This really is
my family.” Also, we would like to thank <i>Mangetout
Catering</i> for partnering with us last month. They
provided delicious major entrees on three occasions.
We appreciate all the donors who make this important
outreach possible.</p>
<p><b>ARCHDIOCESAN COUNCIL OF CATHOLIC WOMEN</b>.
“What? Crime and Human Trafficking in My
Neighborhood?” is Sister Susan Francois’ topic at the
Central Deanery meeting of the Archdiocesan Council
of Catholic Women on Thursday, March 26, 2009. An
open business meeting from 3:00–5:00pm precedes
refreshments and the speaker from 6:00-7:00pm in the
Issac Orr Room at the Chancery (910 Marion Street).
We will also be collecting school supplies for our

<p><b>HELP A SENIOR IN NEED</b>. Many in our community are
in need of help with transportation, shopping, laundry,
housework, and more. Age, illness, economics, and
disabilities can all be barriers to accomplishing these
routine, daily tasks. By volunteering just a few hours a
month, you can make a huge difference in someone’s
life and provide them peace of mind and the option to
stay in their own home rather than going to an
institutionalized setting. If you are interested in joining
this rewarding ministry, please come to the orientation
on the 2nd floor of the Pastoral Outreach Center on
Tuesday, March 31 at 6:30pm. <i>Information</i>

<p><b>ST. JAMES ESL BOOK CLUB</b>. Join us on Tuesday,
March 31 in the Pastoral Outreach Center to discuss
<i>Jasmine</i> by Bharati Mukherjee. Acclaimed by the <i>Los
Angeles Times Book Review</i> as “artful and arresting”
and “breathtaking,” the book tells the riveting story of
a young woman’s journey and transformation from
rural India to Iowa. <i>Jasmine</i> is a quick read, and a
thought-provoking story of what it means to be
American. Now available in the Cathedral Bookstore.

<p>We are the cathedral for the
Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle
and its Archbishop, The Most
Reverend Alexander J. Brunett.
We are also a parish church for a
vibrant faith community with a
long history that reaches back to
Seattle’s early days.</p>
<p>We are an inner-city parish with an
outreach to many who live on the edge of
poverty and loneliness. We are a diverse
community that welcomes, accepts, and
celebrates the differences we all bring. We
exist in the heart of the city, yet sometimes
our parishioners come from considerable
distances to worship here.</p>
<p>St. James Cathedral is a crossroads where
ideas and challenges both old and new are
explored in the light of the Gospel of Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>Our cathedral is also the center for many
cultural and ecumenical events which both
reflect and help to shape the fabric of a vital
metropolitan community.</p>
<p>Above all, St. James Cathedral is a
community of prayer.</p>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>.
This week we remember in prayer the parishes of St.
Joseph in Ferndale and Issaquah, and Holy Redeemer in
Vancouver.</p>
