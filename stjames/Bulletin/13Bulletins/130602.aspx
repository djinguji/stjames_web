<p><b>OUR NEXT ST. JAMES FILM OFFERING</b> is coming up on
Tuesday, June 11. Our movie will be <i>Guilt Trip</i> with
Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogan. As inventor Andy
Brewster is about to embark on the road trip of a
lifetime, a quick stop at his mom's house turns into an
unexpected cross-country voyage with her along for the
ride. According to USCCB movie guide, it is a touching
and amusing story that offers a view of clan interaction
that calls to mind St. Paul's inspired insight that the
first, and perhaps primary, attribute of real love is
patience (1 Cor. 13:4). The film rating is PG-13 –
parents strongly cautioned. The film will be shown in
Cathedral Place, 2nd floor at 7:00pm. Popcorn and
lemonade will be provided and you are welcome to
bring your favorite movie treats. <i>Information</i>,

Gleaners go out in the morning, once a week, usually as partners, to four local 
supermarkets and collect food. These

a fun and rewarding outreach! <i>Information</i>,
