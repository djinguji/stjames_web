<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>“<i>Remember that you are dust and to dust you shall return</i>.” Along with
millions of people around the world, we heard those words this past Wednesday as
we received the blessed ashes on our foreheads. But I have to think that, this
particular Lent, the momentous news of Pope Benedict’s resignation will be a more
powerful reminder of human mortality than even the ashes of Ash Wednesday. In
making his courageous decision, the Pope was, among other things, making a
profound statement about mortality — his own and ours. He was saying something
very powerful about the transitory nature of human life. His own increasing
infirmity and the crushing demands of his office were, as he saw it, God’s way of
telling him that it was time to step aside.</p>
<p>“<i>Remember that you are dust and to dust you shall return</i>.” We should be
grateful to Pope Benedict for giving us such a powerful and credible example of
what it means to humbly face one’s own mortality. Benedict has often been referred
to as ‘the teaching Pope.’ This may well be one of his finest moments as teacher and
one of the most enduring of all his teachings.</p>
<p>I can only consider it as providential that the Pope’s announcement
coincided with the beginning of Lent, a time of intense prayer and reflection for the
entire Church. This year, as the Church sails into uncharted waters, we need to
focus our prayer on the Church and its needs. It would be hard to overestimate the
challenges and the opportunities facing the Church at this time. In our prayer for
the Church, let us also include the College of Cardinals who will soon gather in
Rome to elect a new Pope. May the Holy Spirit who came upon the apostles and the
Church at Pentecost breathe forth wisdom and courage to spark a New Pentecost in
our time!</p>

Growing Food in Burkina
Faso. In the small West
African nation of Burkina
Faso, 80% of the population
are farmers. Frequent
droughts make it difficult to produce enough food for
the entire year. Often, farmers can only grow enough to
feed their families for seven months. The rest of the
year is called “the hungry season.” This week, we pray
for families in Burkina Faso and give to CRS Rice

<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. For those who wish, babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially
registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to register</i>.
Registered parishioners receive important mailings
from the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are
regular recipients of the Cathedral’s quarterly journal <i>In
Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate their wedding at the
Cathedral, and their children may attend any of the five
Catholic Rainbow Schools at parishioner rates.
Registration cards can be found in the vestibule. <i>If you
are not sure whether or not you’re registered, call the
Parish Office, 206-622-3559</i>.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight,
and the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect
way to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b>. Please come by after
the 10:00 Mass. All proceeds for the month of
February benefit the Cathedral Music Program. The
Espresso Ministry is also looking for volunteers
willing to run the cart after the noon Mass.

James Cathedral as the beneficiary, and Bartell’s will
contribute up to 4% of your purchases to St. James
Cathedral every time you shop there and present your

over $1,200 in contributions from this program!</p>

<p><b>DO YOU WISH TO PROCLAIM GOD’S WORD AT
MASS?</b> New readers are always welcome! We
