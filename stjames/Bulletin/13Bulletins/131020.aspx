<p><b>THE WAY OF COMPANIONSHIP</b>. How can we reach out
with love to those who are hurting? How can I see the

many times when we are called up to listen to another
person, to hear their story and to offer some kind of help
or support. Kae Eaton from the Mental Health
Chaplaincy will present a training in the practice of
companionship, a way of being gently present to
another and sharing a little of the journey together. This
training is strongly recommended for everyone involved
in ministry to those on the margins. Saturday,
November 2, 9:00 am to 12:00 pm, Cathedral Hall.

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>With one more Sunday (this one) to go before returning to my familiar, and favored, haunts, I
thought I’d try my hand at some long distance communicating. If it’s a little rough, it’s mostly because
I’m using a friend’s laptop and it’s a good bit more hi-tech than I am!</p>
<p>I had some wonderful days in the Holy Land with my sister, Janet, and her husband, George. It
was their first visit and I got to play tour guide (with some far more competent local assistance). We
spent nearly a week in Jerusalem visiting the Old City and all its wonders, including the Temple Mount,
the Via Dolorosa, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the Wailing Wall, Mount Zion, the Pool of
Bethesda, and so many other wonderful places. Bethlehem was on the itinerary, too, of course, as well
as Bethany, the Mount of Olives, Jericho, the Jordan River, the Dead Sea, Qumran (where the Dead Sea
Scrolls were discovered), and Masada. Two memories stand out from those days: it happened to be the
Jewish feast of Succoth or Tabernacles and I found it so very fascinating to see thousands of Orthodox
Jewish families dressed in the Sabbath best celebrating this joyous feast with its rich traditions. The
other memory is of celebrating Mass at the Church of Dominus Flevit which overlooks Jerusalem from
the Mount of Olives and remembers the place Jesus wept over the Holy City not long before his passion
and death.</p>
<p>From Jerusalem, we went north to Galilee. To beautiful Tiberias along the shores of the Sea of
Galilee. From Tiberias we visited Nazareth, Capernaum, Cana, the Mount of the Beatitudes, and Mount
Tabor, traditional site of the Transfiguration. An outdoor Mass on the Mount of Beatitudes overlooking
the Sea of Galilee (reading “Blessed are the peacemakers” almost in sight of war-torn Syria), and Mass
at the Church of the Transfiguration high atop Mount Tabor, are standout memories that will always
remain with me. Needless to say, you were all very much in my thoughts and prayers.</p>
<p>After leaving Israel, I spent a wonderful week in Rome visiting friends and enjoying old haunts
exactly 50 years after I arrived there as a student. I also had a wonderful opportunity to see Pope Francis
(along with about 75,000 others – being pastor of St. James carries no privileges there, nor should it!).
Happily, you don’t need to get very close to Pope Francis to ‘get’ who he is. He seems close even at a
distance, and comes across as the vibrant, warm, approachable ‘people person’ that he is. It was such a
joy to see him and to hear his simple, down-to-earth yet powerful message.</p>
<p>Another joy was celebrating Mass at the altar/tomb of Blessed, soon-to-be-Saint, John XXIII –
something I have wanted to do for a long time. It happened to be October 12, just one day after his feast,
so that was an added joy. My ‘congregation’ for the Mass was a lovely group of people from the
Philippines. They made me feel right at home (!) and seemed happy for Mass in English rather than in
Italian or Latin! And you will be amused to know that the Missal I was given for celebrating the Mass
was the old one we had to stop using two years ago. You can probably imagine how happy I was about
that. Only in Rome, I thought!</p>
<p>As we all know, there are no unmixed blessings in life. Along the way, I managed to pick up a
really nasty upper respiratory virus that has laid me low for nearly a week (and if you know me at all,
you know it takes quite a bit for that to happen!). I’m beginning to feel more like myself again and am
more than ready to be home. This week. It will be great to see you!</p>
