<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in loving
memory of Lourdes Dimalanta, from her friends and
family.</p>

received a shipment of wonderful St. Francis statues for
your garden.</p>
<p><b>CREATION: ART IN THE CATHEDRAL CHAPEL</b>. In
conjunction with the series “Heaven and Earth Are Full
of Your Glory,” we are honored to host a show in the
