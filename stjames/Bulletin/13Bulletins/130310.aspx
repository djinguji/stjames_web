<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>OUR ELECT DURING LENT</b>. At our 10:00am Mass you
are seeing our newly Elect wear brown robes while
attending Mass and other liturgies during Lent. This
helps them to know, in a concrete way, that they have
entered a new and significant stage in their final
preparations for Easter. It also anticipates another
change that will take place when they emerge from the
baptismal waters at the Easter Vigil and change to white
robes. Seek them out in our midst and, if possible,
introduce yourself to them after Mass. Let them know
you are praying for them and looking forward to Easter
when they will join us at the Eucharistic table.</p>
<p><b>NEW!!! ST. PATRICK’S DAY PANCAKE BREAKFAST</b>.
Save the date for our first annual pancake breakfast on
St. Patrick’s Day, Sunday, March 17, after the 10:00am
and Noon Masses. The breakfast will benefit our own Solanus Casey Center, which 
provides essential services to homeless and low-income people in the downtown 
area. Breakfast will be $5. Be sure to wear your green!</p>
<p><b>LENTEN HOLY HOUR</b>. Each Friday during Lent, we will
have a Holy Hour with Exposition of the Blessed
Sacrament at 12 Noon. Holy Hour, which includes the
Liturgy of the Hours, meditations, and rosary, is the
perfect midday retreat!</p>

<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During December we made 68
home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions allowed us to help 58 individuals and
families pay their rent and stay safely in their homes. In
addition, we prevented 5 utility shut-offs, provided food
for 39 families, beds and furniture for 15 households,
clothes for 14 people, state identification cards for 2
people, and transportation assistance for 3 individuals.
Our priority is preventing homelessness. This makes
your contributions go a long way. Helping our
neighbors pay their rent is far cheaper than picking up
the pieces after they lose their homes. Members of the
St. Vincent de Paul Society follow Jesus through
service to those in need. Please consider joining our
ministry to the poor among us. <i>Information</i>, Rob Millar

week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Joseph in
Chehalis, Vancouver, Pe Ell, Ferndale, Issaquah, Elma, and
