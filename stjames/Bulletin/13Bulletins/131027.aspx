<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During September we made a
total of 44 home visits to our low income neighbors.
Your contributions helped us keep 38 individuals and
families in their homes, and prevent 4 utility shut-offs.
We provided food for 30 households and clothes for 3
people. In addition, and we gave out 21 vouchers for
beds and furniture. Our priority is preventing
homelessness, which makes your contributions go a
long way. Helping our neighbors pay their rent costs us
an average of $6 per bed night. This is far cheaper than
picking up the pieces after people lose their homes.
Shelters cost $15-20 per night, and motels cost $50 or
more. Members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society
follow Jesus through service to those in need. Bearing
witness to Christ’s compassionate and liberating love,
we show our commitment through person-to-person
contact, always making our home visits in pairs. Please
consider joining our ministry to the poor among us.
