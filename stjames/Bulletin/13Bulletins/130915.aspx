<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I am writing to let you know of an important change in the way in which we minister to
the poor and needy in our neighborhood. As you know, we have a long tradition of taking up a
monthly collection to fund the work of our two St. Vincent de Paul conferences. You know this
because you are always incredibly generous in your support! But you may not know how those
funds are distributed. The members of our two St. Vincent de Paul conferences (our
“Vincentians”) receive approximately 100 calls each month for help with rent, utility bills,
groceries, furniture, and other needs. Our Vincentians schedule home visits, meet the requesting
parties in their own homes and write vouchers to help with the particular needs. The home visit
is a very important part of the Vincentian way of reaching out to those in need. So often, people
in need spend a lot of time going from agency to agency, and from office to office in search of
help. Vincentians reverse that dynamic, bringing the needed resources to the person, instead of
requiring the person to come to them. It may be a small difference, but it’s one way Vincentians
make the act of helping a little easier on the person in need. And it’s modeled on the way St.
Vincent de Paul himself reached out to and lifted up the poor. </p>
<p>This system of home visits is extraordinarily effective at preventing homelessness, and it
works very well if the person in need has a home. But as you know, many of the people who
come to us for help are homeless: they live in shelters, in vehicles, stay temporarily with friends,
and those who have no home address cannot be helped by the Vincentian system of home visits.
That’s exactly why eight years ago we partnered with Catholic Community Services to establish
the Solanus Casey Center. The Solanus Casey Center, located at the corner of Terry Avenue and
James, is a drop-in center where homeless persons who cannot be served by our St. Vincent de
Paul conferences can come for information and financial assistance. In an average month, the
Solanus Casey Center sees about 130 people, referring them to community resources and
providing some modest financial assistance. At the moment, the Center devotes significant time
and resources toward helping homeless people obtain ID cards — something they need before
they can gain access to shelters, temporary employment, or other resources. </p>
<p>This brings me to the purpose of this letter! After consulting with our two conferences of
the St. Vincent de Paul Society, we have decided that one month each year, instead of taking up
the usual collection for the St. Vincent de Paul Society, we will take up a collection to support the
work of the Solanus Casey Center. We believe that this is the best way to make sure that your
generous contributions to help those in need go to all of our needy neighbors, including those
who are homeless. So on the third Sunday of September, we will be taking up a collection to
support the Solanus Casey Center in lieu of the usual St. Vincent de Paul collection. Our two St.
Vincent de Paul Conferences will draw on other gifts and reserves to get them through this one
month each year, so their home visits and distribution of vouchers will continue as usual and you
can rest assured that the people they serve so well will not feel the impact of this change. If you
have any questions about this change, please feel free to contact Patty Bowman, Director of Social
Outreach, at 206-382-4515. </p>
<p>Thank you for your continued generosity to our brothers and sisters in need!</p>
