<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in loving
memory of Catherine Loretta Reid, from her daughter,
her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. A new book by
Archbishop Sartain, <i>Strengthen Your Brothers</i>, is now
in stock, as well as some great new books on St.
Francis of Assisi. Monthly missals are in as well,
including <i>Give Us This Day</i>, a new monthly
publication from Liturgical Press, with readings and
prayers for each day, as well as excellent meditations
by contemporary spiritual authors. We are in search of new bookstore
volunteers to help out one Saturday or Sunday each
month. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b>. Please come by after
the 10:00 Mass. All proceeds for the month of
February benefit the Cathedral Music Program. The
Espresso Ministry is also looking for volunteers
willing to run the cart after the noon Mass.
<i>Information</i>, Katherine Berry, 425-772-0897.</p>
<p><b>CELEBRATING CATHOLIC SCHOOLS</b>. Join us in Cathedral Hall following the 
10:00am and Noon Masses to celebrate our Catholic Schools. Our parish is a 
contributing member of the Rainbow Schools Program whereby children from our 
parish can attend at “parishioner” tuition rates. Approximately 60 cathedral 
children are enrolled in one of these fine schools. Representatives of Sts. 
Edward, George, Paul, Joseph and Therese Catholics Schools are available during 
hospitality after the 10:00 and 12:00 Masses. Our parish has established the 
Cathedral Scholarship Fund to assist families in meeting the financial 
obligation involved in sending their elementary school children to any of the 
Rainbow Schools. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight,
and the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé
in France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect
way to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>LENTEN BIBLE STUDY</b> begins Tuesday, February 19,
2013 and be held on the Tuesdays of Lent up to and
including March 19. We will read through and reflect
on passages from the Book of Job. Meetings will take

celebration of this sacrament on Monday, February 11–the feast day for Our Lady of Lourdes–at the 5:30
Mass. Father Ryan will preside. All are welcome to
attend the Mass. If you would like to receive the

<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. For those who wish, babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially
registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to register</i>.
Registered parishioners receive important mailings
from the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are
regular recipients of the Cathedral’s quarterly journal <i>In
Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate their wedding at the
Cathedral, and their children may attend any of the five
Catholic Rainbow Schools at parishioner rates.
Registration cards can be found in the vestibule. <i>If you
are not sure whether or not you’re registered, call the
Parish Office, 206-622-3559</i>.</p>

<p><b>DO YOU WISH TO PROCLAIM GOD’S WORD AT
MASS?</b> New readers are always welcome! We
especially need readers for the 8:00am Mass, but no
matter which Mass you attend, we invite you to use
your talents for the proclamation of God’s Word.
Audition and training are required. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>WOULD YOU CONSIDER ASSISTING A PERSON</b> who
wants to become Catholic? We have a number of new
inquirers starting our Christian Initiation process
(RCIA) to learn more about the Catholic Church. We
need St. James parishioners to be companions with
some of our new inquirers to help welcome them to our
community. The time commitment is reasonable — two
Wednesday evening sessions a month. Training and
support are provided. The rewards are many, including
renewal and update of your own faith and “kudos” in
heaven. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>IS HOSPITALITY YOUR GIFT, SOMETHING YOU ENJOY?</b>
We are looking for a “few good people” to assist in
setting up, greeting participants, and putting things
away for our weekly RCIA gathering. The time commitment is once a month from 
6:00-9:30pm. It is a great way to meet new people and support an important 
parish ministry. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>TOILETRY DONATIONS</b>. We are collecting donations of
toiletries for our Winter Shelter and for the Solanus
Casey Center. Please bring in donations of individual
packets of tissues, razors, deodorant, toothbrushes,
combs, and shaving cream. Drop them off at Coffee
Hour after masses or at the parish office Monday-Friday 9am-5pm.</p>
<p><b>HELP FEED THE HUNGRY</b>. Operation Nightwatch is an
ecumenical Christian ministry providing hot meals and
shelter referrals to 150-200 homeless people every
night. St. James parishioners cook and serve dinner at
the Nightwatch Center three times a month. We
currently need four volunteers to serve dinner the first
and third Tuesday of the month from 8:30-10:30pm.
We are also in need of food donors. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of Holy Redeemer
in Vancouver and Sacred Heart in LaConner and Winlock.</p>
