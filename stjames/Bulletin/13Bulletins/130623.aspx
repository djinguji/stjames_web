<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James
Cathedral is proud to welcome visitors from
near and far throughout the summer months.
Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will
be made from among all the visitor envelopes used.
Please write your address on the visitor envelope
provided in the pew and drop it with your offering into
the collection basket. Thank you for adding to the
power of our prayer by your presence in our midst
today. <b>Last week, we had visitors from 
Estero, FL;
Colorado Springs, CO; Ketchikan, AK; and many
other places! The winner of our drawing was from

<p><b>THE SPIRITUAL EXERCISES IN EVERYDAY LIFE</b> is a
nine month retreat format of the Spiritual Exercises of
St. Ignatius of Loyola, with retreat communities

program of prayer and reflection that can be
done by busy people of varied backgrounds and
Christian traditions in the midst of their daily lives. Retreatants commit themselves to praying everyday
(ideally for one hour), meeting twice monthly with a
Spiritual Director, and to attending monthly Saturday
retreat days. <i>Information</i>.
