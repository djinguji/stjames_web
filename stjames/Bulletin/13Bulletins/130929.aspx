<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Summer is officially over. Happily, I can say that Mass attendance
was surprisingly good through the summer months, although honesty
compels me to acknowledge that visitors filled in a good number of the
empty seats! Now, with visitor season over, it’s going to be up to our
regulars to do that. And if you’re a ‘regular’ who has been a little less than
regular through the summer months, it’s good to have you back at St. James.</p>
<p>I suppose I shouldn’t say too much about such things because I left
for vacation this past week. Summer vacations don’t work so well for me
because of weddings (and, this year, an exceptionally large number of
funerals), so fall is my time. Among other things, I’m planning to spend
more than a week on pilgrimage in the Holy Land with my sister and
brother-in-law. You can be sure I will be remembering you in prayer in
those holy places.</p>
<p>If you’ve been following the bulletin the last couple of weekends, you
are aware that things are ‘full steam ahead’ at St. James, with a number of
our wonderful ministries cranking up as well as some exciting new
educational events and programs. Please keep an eye on the bulletin and on
our great website. And, speaking of the bulletin, I encourage you to take
your bulletin home when you leave Mass each weekend. There are more
than enough bulletins to go around and the reason we have so many printed
is because we hope that you will keep up on what’s happening at the
Cathedral by referring to the bulletin during the week.</p>
<p>I hope you will take advantage of some of the wonderful offerings we
have in store in the months ahead. See you in a couple of weeks!</p>
