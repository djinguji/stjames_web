<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a

<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL CONFERENCES</b> of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During November we made 49
home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions allowed us to help 30 individuals and
families pay their rent and stay safely in their homes. In
addition, we prevented 3 utility shut-offs, provided food
for 40 families, beds and furniture for 18 households,
clothes for 5 people, and transportation assistance for 2
individuals. Our priority is preventing homelessness.
This makes your contributions go a long way. Helping
our neighbors pay their rent is far cheaper than picking
up the pieces after they lose their homes. Members of
the St. Vincent de Paul Society follow Jesus through
service to those in need. Bearing witness to Christ’s
compassionate and liberating love, we show our
commitment through person-to-person contact, making
our home visits in pairs. Please consider joining our
ministry to the poor among us. <i>Information</i>, Rob Millar

are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of Immaculate
Conception in Seattle, Everett, Arlington, and Mount
Vernon, and the Immaculate Conception Mission in
