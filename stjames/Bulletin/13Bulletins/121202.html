<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>ADVENT BAZAAR</b>. Today, after the morning Masses, at
coffee hour in Cathedral Hall, you are invited to start
your Christmas shopping at our annual Advent bazaar,
specializing in fair trade items and great gifts
supporting excellent causes. If you ordered a Christmas
wreath or poinsettia, you can pick it up today. You can
also stop by to donate socks or toiletries, or to take a
tag from our Giving Tree.</p>
<p><b>SAINT KATERI TEKAKWITHA</b>. The Archdiocese of
Seattle has commissioned a large icon of one of the
newest saints of the Church, Kateri Tekakwitha, the
first Native American to be canonized. The icon is in
the Cathedral Chapel for a short time—stop by to view
it and to read a little more about this extraordinary icon
of an extraordinary woman.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. Cathedral Christmas cards
are back in stock, including some beautiful new
designs! Also, Sunday Missals for 2013 are now in, as
well as some wonderful new prayer books for young
children.</p>
<p><b>FIRST FRIDAY EXPOSITION AND HOLY HOUR</b>. This
coming Friday, December 7, Exposition of the Blessed
Sacrament will begin following the 8:15am Mass and
continue until 1:00pm. Holy Hour will begin at 12:00
Noon, with readings, hymns, and rosary as we prepare
to honor Mary’s Immaculate Conception on December
8. You are invited to join in all or part of this
contemplative prayer in the presence of the Blessed
Sacrament.</p>
<p><b>HOLY DAY SCHEDULE</b>. During the coming week, we
will celebrate the Solemnity of the Immaculate
Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. There will be
two holy day Masses in the Cathedral: Friday,
December 7 at 5:30pm, and Saturday, December 8 at
8:15am. <i>Please note that the evening Mass on
December 8 will be an Advent Mass, not a Mass of the
Immaculate Conception</i>.</p>
<p><b>REST IN PEACE</b>. Please pray for the repose of the soul
of Iris Ivey.</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES MUSIC FOR ADVENT</b> continues on
December 8, 8:00 pm with our own nationally-acclaimed

<p><b>THANKSGIVING AT THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN</b>. Last
Wednesday morning, five volunteers prepared and
baked 25 pumpkin pies, even making homemade crust!
With 30 volunteers on Thanksgiving Day, we prepared
a beautiful traditional turkey dinner for 191 guests. We
received donations of sixteen 15lb. birds, as well as
plenty of potatoes, green beans, onions, bread,
cranberries, and milk to prepare a very tasty meal. We
know, particularly this year with our volunteer guest
chef, that there was not a more satisfying meal served
anywhere in the city of Seattle. Thank you to all of you
that participated in this beautiful “table” of plenty, for
our less fortunate brothers and sisters who come to our
door. Our guests thank you!</p>
<p><b>TOILETRY DONATIONS</b>. We are collecting donations of
toiletries for our Winter Shelter and for the Solanus
Casey Center. Please bring in donations of shaving
cream, razors, soaps, lotions, etc. Drop them off at
Coffee Hour after masses or at the parish office M-F
9am-5pm.</p>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Francis
Xavier in Toledo, St. Nicholas in Gig Harbor, and St.
Barbara in Black Diamond.</p>
