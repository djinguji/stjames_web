<p><b>STATIONS OF THE CROSS</b>. The unique Stations of the
Cross hanging in the Cathedral during Lent are the
work of Cathedral iconographer Joan Brand-Landkamer. They were inspired by the work of 20th-century
French artist Georges Rouault. The stations
were created from found objects which Landkamer
collected near her home in Ocean Shores. Each station
is unique, and together they form a stark and intensely
moving portrayal of the last journey of Jesus. You are
invited to pray the Stations of the Cross Mondays after
12:10pm Midday Prayer, Wednesday evenings after
5:30pm Mass, and Friday mornings, after 8:15am Mass.</p>
