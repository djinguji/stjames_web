<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>“Don’t ask the questions if you’re unwilling to deal with the answers.”
That’s good advice for just about everyone, and it’s especially good advice
for a parish leader when it comes to conducting a survey. And, believe me,
it was much on my mind when we decided to conduct a survey of one
thousand parish households back in the fall of 2010. The survey was
designed to gauge the strengths of our Cathedral parish as well as the areas
where the needs of our parishioners were not being met. The results of the
survey shaped our parish vision statement and have also guided our
parish programs these last two years.</p>
<p>In the main, the survey told me and the Cathedral’s pastoral ministry
team that people love this parish. They love the way we pray together, the
way we welcome people, the way we teach about the faith, the way we
reach out in loving service to the poor, and the way we advocate for justice.
That was all very reassuring, to say the least.</p>
<p><b>But some of the questions we asked triggered responses that were
quite challenging</b>. I think, for instance, of the comments and complaints
about the sound system in the Cathedral. We have been working hard to
address those ever since, conducting a survey of your experience of the
sound system last summer, which helped us to isolate problem areas. As
you may have noticed, we have adjusted sound levels throughout the
Cathedral, and replaced the ambo microphone. And we continue to
explore ways to improve sound levels in all areas of the Cathedral.</p>
<p>I think also of the comments we received about community and
community-building in the parish. We have undertaken some new efforts
to address those concerns as well: launching a new Family Ministry in July,
2012, to provide greater support for our couples preparing for marriage as
well as our families. In addition, programs like Camino Seattle and the St.
Patrick’s Day Breakfast have served as great community-building events.</p>
<p><b>Most challenging of all, however, were the comments regarding a
perceived lack of outreach to our teenage parishioners</b> or, to put it in a
positive way, the hopes expressed by people that we would take significant
steps to address the needs of our teenagers, a growing and dynamic part of
our community. It’s not that we haven’t done things for our young people.
In addition to the faith formation program, a good number of our
teenagers are very engaged as altar servers, youth readers, Eucharistic
Ministers, and as members of our two choirs for teenagers, Jubilate! and St.
Edward’s Vocal Ensemble. And some have taken part in service
opportunities like the summer Youth Migrant Program. But there are so
many possibilities beyond those and, to be honest, we have not been able
to address them.</p>
<p>Until now!</p>
<p><b>I can’t tell you how happy I am to announce that this June we are
launching a new and exciting Youth Ministry Program</b>. As director of the
program, we are extremely blessed to be able hire our own parishioner, Joe
Cotton, who for years has been something of an icon for youth ministry in
this Archdiocese. Joe has been an outstanding leader in this area of
ministry, serving ably and effectively as Youth Minister in parishes. He has
also been heavily involved in juvenile detention ministry for the
Archdiocese both as director and hands-on minister, and he has taught
junior high students in one of our Catholic schools. But his long list of
past involvements doesn’t tell the whole story. Joe is a wonderful young
man with deep faith, excellent people-skills, and a strong commitment to
serving the poor and advocating for justice. And he’s a Pied Piper when it
comes to young people!</p>
<p>Speaking personally, this new moment in our life as a parish is a very
fulfilling one. I feel that we are, in a sense, coming of age. Years ago, there
was no need at St. James Cathedral for a youth minister because there were
very few young people. No more. We have become a parish with large
numbers of children and young people who come with their families to the
Cathedral each week from all over the Puget Sound region. They are our
future and it is only right that we should be looking for every way possible
to involve them in the life of the parish and to let them know how
important they are.</p>
<p>Let me return to where I began: I am glad we asked you the questions
we did back in 2010, and I’m glad you were so honest in answering them.
Now, thanks to your ongoing generous support, we are taking this step
forward in faith, confident that God who has led us to this point will
continue with us each step of the way into a very bright future!</p>

<p><b>SPIRITUALITY ON TAP: JESUITS ON THE FRONTIER</b>.
The lives of Francis Xavier and Matteo Ricci give us
some insights into the Jesuit missionaries and how they
were able to maintain friendships across great
distances. What were Francis Xavier’s successes and
failures on his voyages and what inspired Matteo Ricci
to write his book On Friendship? What does this tell us
about their work as missionaries? Join other young
adults for an evening of discussion on the lessons from
those travels and a reflection on their applications to
our own as we ourselves maintain friendships around
the nation and world. Spirituality on Tap is hosted this
month at St. Catherine of Siena Church (814 NE 85th
St. Seattle) from 7:00pm-9:00pm on Thursday, April
