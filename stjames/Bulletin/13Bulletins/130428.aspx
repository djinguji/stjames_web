<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>After six years of serving as directors of the Cathedral Kitchen, Jill and Jim
McAuliffe have decided that it is time for them to step down. I know their decision
was a difficult one to make and I can assure you that it was a difficult one for me to
accept!</p>
<p>I want to take this opportunity to thank Jill and Jim for their incredibly
committed service to the Cathedral Kitchen over these years. They had been
committed volunteers for nine years in the Family Kitchen when they took the reins
of the “Cathedral Kitchen” in May, 2007. Not only have they carried on the great
Catholic Worker tradition that they inherited, they have also built on that tradition
and strengthened it. Day after day they have worked hard to create a warm, caring
atmosphere where everyone was welcome and everyone was treated with love and
respect.</p>
<p>They have also succeeded in recruiting a large and truly exceptional group of
volunteers who have staffed the Kitchen day after day, collecting the donated food,
preparing absolutely delicious meals, warmly welcoming the guests, serving them
with a smile, visiting with them, and doing the clean-up afterwards.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to calculate just how many lives Jim and Jill have touched
over their years of service at the Cathedral Kitchen but this much is certain: they
have made a whole lot of lives happier and they have made it possible for hundreds
and hundreds of hungry folks not only to enjoy a wonderful meal but to be
reminded of their dignity and worth.</p>
<p>In expressing gratitude to Jill and Jim, I also want to welcome to new leadership
roles in the Kitchen three parishioners who have long been involved in the Kitchen
and who will now take over its leadership. They are Teddi Callahan, Carol
DeMatteis, and Jack Chen. We have been blessed for years by their faithful service
to the Kitchen and I know that, in their new leadership roles, they will walk
comfortably in Jill and Jim’s footsteps.</p>

<p><b>ECUMENICAL ICON OF THE RESURRECTION</b>. This
weekend, St. James Cathedral is privileged once again
to host a beautiful icon of Christ’s Resurrection. The
icon, written by Yakov Prokofiev of St. Petersburg, was
commissioned by the St. Petersburg Seattle Sister
Churches Board to celebrate the 20th anniversary of
their program, which encourages friendly relations
between churches in Seattle and St. Petersburg. The
icon was blessed by Metropolitan Vladimir and brought
to Seattle in the summer of 2011. During this Easter
Season, it is again traveling around the Pacific
Northwest to churches of many Christian
denominations. Special thanks to Jane and Dick Carter
of St. Mark’s Cathedral for sharing the icon with us.</p>

impressive demonstration of your generosity. The
Blood Center and St. James Health and Healing
Ministry extend a grateful thank you to all who
participated.</p>
