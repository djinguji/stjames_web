<p><b>ST. JAMES FILM NIGHT</b> is Tuesday, June 11. Our movie
will be <i>Guilt Trip</i> with Barbra Streisand and Seth
Rogan. As inventor Andy Brewster is about to embark
on the road trip of a lifetime, a quick stop at his mom's
house turns into an unexpected cross-country voyage
with her along for the ride. According to USCCB movie guide, it is a touching 
and amusing story that offers a view of clan interaction that calls to mind St. 
Paul's inspired insight that the first, and perhaps primary, attribute of real 
love is patience (1 Cor. 13:4). The film rating is PG-13 – parents strongly 
cautioned. The film will be shown in Cathedral Place, 2nd floor at 7:00pm, and 
there will be time for some discussion following the film. Popcorn and lemonade 
will be provided and you are welcome to bring your favorite movie treats. <i>Information</i>,
