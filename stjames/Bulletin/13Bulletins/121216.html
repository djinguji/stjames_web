<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. Cathedral Christmas cards
are now in stock, including some beautiful new
designs! Also, Sunday Missals for 2013 are in, as well
as some wonderful new prayer books for young
children. And Cathedral Music CDs make great
Christmas gifts! Share your Cathedral with family and
friends.</p>
<p><b>DEDICATION OF THE CATHEDRAL</b>. On Friday,
December 21 at the 5:30pm Mass, we will celebrate
our annual solemnity marking the anniversary of
dedication of this Cathedral church. St. James was
dedicated on December 22, 1907 by Bishop Edward
O’Dea, and rededicated on December 22, 1994 by
Archbishop Thomas J. Murphy. The Mass will begin
with a procession through the Cathedral for the lighting
of the dedication candles. All are welcome to
participate as we celebrate this beautiful house of
prayer.</p>
<p><b>NO TAIZE PRAYER FRIDAY 12/21</b>. On Friday, December
21, in order to prepare the Cathedral for Christmas
services, we are not able to have our usual Taizé Prayer
service. Taizé Prayer will resume on Friday, December
28 at 6:30pm.</p>
<p><b>COMMUNAL RECONCILIATION SERVICES</b> will be held
on <b>Monday, December 17</b> at <b>7:30pm</b> (<i>not 4:00pm as
printed in the monthly calendar</i>) and <b>Saturday,
December 22</b> at <b>4:00pm</b>. During these beautiful
services of readings, reflection and song, we will open
ourselves to experience the gift of God’s gracious and
loving forgiveness in the Sacrament of Penance. It has
long been a tradition in the church to confess one’s sins
before celebrating the great feast of Christmas. These
will be ideal times to do so.</p>
<p><b>CHRISTMAS MASSES</b>. Christmas at the Cathedral
begins at 5:30pm on Monday, December 24 with the
Vigil Mass of Christmas, and continues with the
Midnight Mass, and the Masses of Christmas Day—8:00am, 10:00am, and 12:00 Noon. Solemn Vespers of
Christmas will be at 4:00pm on Christmas Day. (<i>There
is no 5:30pm Mass on Christmas Day</i>.) View the
<a href="../../Events/2012/christmas12.htm">complete schedule</a> of Christmas 
Masses at St. James Cathedral.</p>

16 and older are invited to complete their Christian
initiation beginning in early 2013. Confirmation classes
start Thursday evening January 17 and continue weekly
through April 11. The Rite of Confirmation will be

<p dir="ltr"><b>SACRIFICIAL SUNDAY GIVING</b>. We are four weeks into
our annual Sacrificial Giving campaign. We have
heard from more than 700 parishioners—which is great
news! But that leaves 1,900 who have not yet
completed a pledge card for 2013. <i>Please complete and
turn in a card even if you are unable to commit to a
specific amount in 2013</i>. This will save you from
receiving follow up letters and e-mails. If you are able
to give, please turn in your pledge today or go 
<a href="../../Contribute/sacrificialgiving.htm">online</a> to
<a target="_bulletin" href="https://www.stjames-cathedral.org/BusinessCenter/Giving.aspx">make a pledge</a>. Thank
you!</p>
<p><b>DO YOU SHOP AT BARTELL’S?</b> If you shop at Bartell’s, every purchase you make can benefit St.
James Cathedral if you register for their “B” Caring
program. Ask at Bartell’s for details. If you’re already
signed up, be sure to use your “B” Caring card when
you check out.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially
registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to register</i>.
Registered parishioners receive important mailings
from the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are
regular recipients of the Cathedral’s quarterly journal <i>In
Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate their wedding at the
Cathedral, and their children may attend any of the five
Catholic Rainbow Schools at parishioner rates.
Registration cards can be found in the vestibule. <i>If you
are not sure whether or not you’re registered, call the
Parish Office, 206-622-3559</i>.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL KIDS EPIPHANY PARTY</b>. Saturday, January 5, 11:30am—2:00pm,

defects, and I’ve put up with yours. We’ll
