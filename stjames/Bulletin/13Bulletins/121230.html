<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>THE MENTAL HEALTH MINISTRY RESOURCE CENTER</b> is
open TODAY, 9am – 2pm. Please drop in! The
resource center provides information related to mental
health/illnesses, emotional distress, living well; referrals
to professional and medical assistance, as well as
someone to listen, talk to, guide you through. We will
have brochures, reference books and other reading
materials available – all in a relaxed, comfortable and
welcoming environment. Come and visit. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>NEW YEAR’S EVE CONCERT</b>. This year marks the 30th anniversary of a 
wonderful Seattle New Year’s Eve tradition—the New Year’s Eve Gala at St. James. 
Beginning at 11:00pm, this year’s concert features the magnificent music of 
Mozart, congregational hymns, and as always—a Midnight Surprise! This is a safe, 
sane, sacred, and sober way to usher in the New Year 2013. Passes are available

<p><b>FIRST FRIDAY</b>. On Friday, January 4, Exposition of the

Hour beginning at 12 Noon. This Christmastide Holy
Hour will include readings, carols, and the rosary. All
are welcome to participate in all or part of this prayer in
the presence of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight, and
the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect way
to end a busy week.</p>
