<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Last week’s wonderful celebration of the feast of St. James is already
disappearing in the rearview mirror. Before it entirely fades, I want to take
this opportunity to thank everyone who worked so hard to make the
liturgies so beautiful and the picnic so enjoyable. As you might imagine, it
takes a whole lot of planning and a huge number of generous volunteers to
make a celebration like that happen. To each of you who contributed in
any way to that wonderful event, a heartfelt word of thanks.</p>
<p>Thanks, too, to all of you who took time to fill out those little
anniversary cards for me last Sunday. Reading them was both rewarding
and challenging (‘how can I ever live up to such generous accolades?’ I
found myself thinking, and the answer is, ‘I can’t!’). More than anything,
however, your thoughtful messages made me even more aware than usual
of how blessed I am to serve as your pastor. And, don’t worry, it’s not
going to be another 25 years (!), although, God willing, we still have some
more miles to travel together.</p>
<p>I am happy to be able to announce that we have not only met our
Annual Catholic Appeal goal, we have exceeded it! If you were following
the bulletin, you know that it seemed touch-and-go for a while, but thanks
to the generosity of 869 of you, and to the extraordinary generosity of
several of you who made a second pledge, we more than cleared the
goalpost. God is good. So are you!</p>
<p>It has been quite an exceptional summer, hasn’t it! I hope that with the
beautiful weather have come some opportunities for relaxation and
renewal. And, thankfully, there’s still a month to go. Enjoy!</p>
