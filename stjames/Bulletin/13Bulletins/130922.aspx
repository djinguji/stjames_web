<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>The recent change in weather has left us in no doubt that fall has
arrived. But what a summer it was! I hope you had an opportunity to enjoy
the incredible weather and to ‘kick back’ a little.</p>
<p>Speaking of change, I need to let you know of a change in our pastoral
team. TerryAnn Bowen, our Director of Faith Formation and RCIA, will be
leaving us at the end of this month.</p>
<p>I know you will want to join me in wishing Godspeed to TerryAnn.
She has decided to leave her position here in order to pursue her doctoral
degree as well as other ministerial opportunities. TerryAnn joined our staff
in 2006 as director of our Welcome Back and adult Confirmation programs,
and since 2011, she has ministered faithfully and lovingly as director of the
RCIA and other adult educational programs. Those of you who have had
the privilege of getting to know TerryAnn are aware of what a beautifully
caring person she is. She has touched many lives by her ability to listen, to
affirm, to teach, and to inspire. As she takes her leave from our staff (not our
parish!), I know you will want to join me in wishing her well and keeping
her in your prayers.</p>
<p>During the period between now and when a new RCIA director has
been identified, I am grateful to Patty Bowman, our director of social
outreach, for stepping into RCIA as interim director. She will be assisted by
Corinna Laughlin, director of liturgy, and by our very gifted RCIA team.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>

memory of Ryan Matthew Cueto, from his mother and
father on the first anniversary of his death.</p>

<p><b>ARE YOU OR A FRIEND INTERESTED IN LEARNING
MORE ABOUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH OR BECOMING
CATHOLIC?</b> You are invited to participate in the RCIA,
a process of initiation into the Catholic community of
faith. It is a process which encompasses the study of
Scripture, Catholic teaching, and Christian values—the
development and deepening of a life of prayer and
action—all with the support and involvement of the
parish community. You can learn more by going to
the <a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA">RCIA website</a>.

Place, second floor. <i>Information</i>,

companions with our new inquirers to help welcome
them to our community. The time commitment is
reasonable — two Wednesday evening sessions a
month. Training and support are provided.
