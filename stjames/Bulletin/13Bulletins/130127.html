<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b>. Last Sunday, flowers were
offered by Aurora Turla and family, in memory of
Jose Turla on the anniversary of his death. This
Sunday’s flowers are in loving memory of Fel L.
Ordonia, Sr. from his wife Aurora, his daughter
Audrey Ghali, and family.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. A new book by
Archbishop Sartain, <i>Strengthen Your Brothers</i>, is now
in stock, as well as some great new books on St.
Francis of Assisi. Monthly missals are in as well,
including <i>Give Us This Day</i>, a new monthly
publication from Liturgical Press, with readings and
prayers for each day, as well as excellent meditations
by contemporary spiritual authors. Highly
recommended. We are in search of new bookstore
volunteers to help out one Saturday or Sunday each
month. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>OUR NEXT ST. JAMES FILM OFFERING</b> is on Tuesday,

mother in order to discontinue the medical procedures she has endured. (Film 
rating PG13). We will include an opportunity for discussion following the film. 
The film will be shown in Cathedral Place, 2nd floor at 7:00pm. Popcorn and

<p><b>CELEBRATING CATHOLIC SCHOOLS – RAINBOW
SCHOOLS COALITION</b>. On Sunday, February 3, we will
celebrate Catholic Schools, and in a particular way the
Cathedral children who attend one of the five Rainbow
Schools. Our parish is a contributing member of the
Rainbow Schools Program whereby children from our
parish can attend at “parishioner” tuition rates.
Approximately 60 cathedral children are enrolled in one
of these terrific schools. On February 3 representatives
of St. Edward, St. George, St. Paul, St. Joseph and St.
Therese Catholics Schools will be available following
the 10:00am and Noon Masses during hospitality. In
addition, our parish has established the Cathedral
Scholarship Fund to assist families in meeting the
financial obligation involved in sending their
elementary school aged children to any one of the
Rainbow Schools. Please note: Children attending
Catholic schools are encouraged to come to Mass in
their uniforms! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>WOULD YOU CONSIDER ASSISTING A PERSON</b> who
wants to become Catholic? We have a number of new
inquirers starting our Christian Initiation process
(RCIA) to learn more about the Catholic Church. We
need St. James parishioners to be companions with
some of our new inquirers to help welcome them to our
community. The time commitment is reasonable — two
Wednesday evening sessions a month. Training and
support are provided. The rewards are many, including
renewal and update of your own faith and “kudos” in
heaven. <i>Information</i>,

Bowen</a>, 206-382-2018.</p>
<p><b>IS HOSPITALITY YOUR GIFT, SOMETHING YOU ENJOY?</b>
We are looking for a “few good people” to assist in
setting up, greeting participants, and putting things
away for our weekly RCIA gathering. The time commitment is once a month from 
6:00-9:30pm. It is a great way to meet new people and support an important 
parish ministry. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>TOILETRY DONATIONS</b>. We are collecting donations of
toiletries for our Winter Shelter and for the Solanus
Casey Center. Please bring in donations of individual
packets of tissues, razors, deodorant, toothbrushes,
combs, and shaving cream. Drop them off at Coffee
Hour after masses or at the parish office Monday-Friday 9am-5pm.</p>
<p><b>HELP FEED THE HUNGRY</b>. Operation Nightwatch is an
ecumenical Christian ministry providing hot meals and
shelter referrals to 150-200 homeless people every
night. St. James parishioners cook and serve dinner at
the Nightwatch Center three times a month. We
currently need four volunteers to serve dinner the first
and third Tuesday of the month from 8:30-10:30pm.
We are also in need of food donors. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>SACRIFICIAL GIVING 2013</b>. Our Sacrificial Giving campaign is winding to 
a close. We have received a grand total of 957 pledges, representing 38% of 
registered parish households. Please note that we are still $91,000 behind last 
year! It’s not too late to make your pledge for 2013. Please consider doing so

difference! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>YEAR-END CONTRIBUTION STATEMENTS</b>. Last week,
statements were e-mailed to all parish households for
whom we have e-mail addresses. This represents a
large savings in printing and postage costs. All
households for whom we do not have e-mails will
receive their statement via US Mail sometime this
week. If you do not receive your statement by January
31, contact Sister Mary Slater, snjm, 206-382-4564.</p>
<p><b>BLESSING OF CANDLES ON THE FEAST OF THE
PRESENTATION</b>. The Feast of the Presentation of the
Lord, which includes the traditional blessing of candles,
is Saturday, February 2. You are invited to bring your
own candles from home for the blessing during the
8:15am Mass. <i>Please note that there is just one Mass
for the feast day this year</i>.</p>
<p><b>SANTO NIÑO CELEBRATION</b>. Visit the Cathedral
website for an <a href="../../Events/2013/album-stonino.htm">album of last Sunday's celebration</a>. A
huge thank you to the Friends of Santo Niño, a group of
Cathedral parishioners who worked for many weeks to
prepare this wonderful fiesta for the entire parish.
Thank you! Maraming salamat po!</p>
