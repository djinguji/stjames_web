<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

<p dir="ltr"><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND/OR BECOMING
CATHOLIC?</b> You are invited to participate in RCIA, a
process of initiation into the Catholic community of
faith. It is a process which encompasses the study of
Scripture, Catholic teaching, and Christian values—the
development and deepening of a life of prayer and
action—all with the support and involvement of the
parish community. You can learn more by going to
the <a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA">RCIA 
website</a>. A new inquiry
session began Wednesday, January 9, 2013 and continues each Wednesday at 7:00 pm 
in Cathedral Place, second floor. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>SPIRITUALITY ON TAP: CENTERING PRAYER—FINDING GOD WITHIN OURSELVES</b>. Thursday, January
17, from 7:00-9:00pm, Kathy Heffernan, a certified
chaplain and spiritual director, and young adults ages
21-35 will come together for an evening of reflection
and discussion at St. James Cathedral’s Pastoral
Outreach Center. Centering Prayer is a method of
silent prayer that prepares us to receive the gift of
contemplative prayer, prayer in which we experience
God's presence within us. This method of prayer is
both a relationship with God and a discipline to foster
that relationship. <i>Information</i>, 
<a href="mailto:clanigan@stjames-cathedral.org?subject=Spirituality on Tap">Caitlin Lanigan</a>, 206-382-4235.</p>
<p><b>LISTENING AND LOVE</b>. Relationships give us the
opportunity to learn a great deal about ourselves as well
as share joy and intimacy, but only if we listen well and
have an awareness of our own needs. Come learn about
how to communicate and how to create a positive
experience for yourself in all the relationships in your
life--family, work, friendships. This event, sponsored
by Cabrini Ministry, will be held Saturday, January 19
from 9:30am–Noon at St. Joseph’s Parish Center, 732
18th Ave. E., 98112. Suggested donation is $20. There

ecumenical Christian ministry providing hot meals and
shelter referrals to 150-200 homeless people every
night. St. James parishioners cook and serve dinner at
the Nightwatch Center three times a month. We
currently need four volunteers to serve dinner the first
and third Tuesday of the month from 8:30-10:30pm.

<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank Cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During December we made 54
home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions allowed us to help 36 individuals and
families pay their rent and stay safely in their homes. In
addition, we prevented 2 utility shut-offs, provided food
for 50 families, beds and furniture for 14 households,
clothes for 6 people, and transportation assistance for 5
individuals. Our priority is preventing homelessness.
Helping our neighbors pay their rent is far less
expensive than picking up the pieces after they lose
their homes. Members of the St. Vincent de Paul
Society follow Jesus through service to those in need.
Bearing witness to Christ’s compassionate and
liberating love, we show our commitment through
person-to-person contact, making our home visits in
pairs. Please consider joining our ministry to the poor
among us. <i>Information</i>, Rob Millar 206-954-8902 and
Tammy Bendix 206-595-9158.</p>
<p><b>IS HOSPITALITY YOUR GIFT?</b> We are looking for a
“few good people” to assist in setting up, greeting
participants, and putting things away for our weekly RCIA gathering. The time commitment is one
Wednesday evening a month from 6:00-9:30pm. It is a
great way to meet new people and support an important
parish ministry. <i>Information</i>,

Bowen</a>, 206-382-2018.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially
registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to register</i>.
Registered parishioners receive important mailings
from the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are
regular recipients of the Cathedral’s journal <i>In Your
Midst</i>, are able to celebrate their wedding at the
Cathedral, and their children may attend any of the five
Catholic Rainbow Schools at parishioner rates.
Registration cards can be found in the vestibules. <i>If you
are not sure whether or not you’re registered, call the
Parish Office, 206-622-3559</i>.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight,
and the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect
way to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Mary in
Castle Rock and Centralia and St. Mary Mission in
Coupeville.</p>
