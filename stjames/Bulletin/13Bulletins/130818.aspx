<p><b>FAITH IS A VERB…</b> Faith grows as we express it in
service to others. Our faith becomes deeper and more
active as we respond by facing our own personal needs
and the needs of others. How are you actively called to
<i>faith</i>? Consider what might be open to you in a variety
of volunteer ministry needs and opportunities—including work with all age groups and in many
capacities. Some take a little time and some a bit
more. Thanks for opening your heart to our volunteer
needs–the growth in faith and the joy of serving others
cannot be measured in human terms. <i>Information</i>,

families, beds and furniture for 13 households, clothes
for 8 people, and transportation assistance for 11
