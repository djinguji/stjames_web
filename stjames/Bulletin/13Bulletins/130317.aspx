<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>In my homily last Sunday, I invited you to join me in praying that we would be
given a Pope who would “lead us to new places.” It would appear that our prayer
has been answered!</p>
<p>“New” seems to be the word of the moment, doesn’t it! Our new Pope comes
from “the new world” – from South America; he has chosen a brand new name,
Francis; he belongs to a religious order, the Society of Jesus, that is entirely new
when it comes to the chair of Peter. And, when he appeared on the great balcony of
St. Peter’s Basilica after his election – new in appearance without all the formal
papal trappings and with a simple, down-to-earth message for the people of his new
diocese and for the world – he gave us reason to believe that his election would
signal the “new Pentecost” that Pope John XXIII prayed for more than fifty years
ago when he called the Second Vatican Council.</p>
<p>It is too early, of course, to try to predict what new things Pope Francis might do,
or what new horizons he may be willing to explore in the days and years to come.
But even now, I sense that the list of “new things” I mentioned above will grow in
the days to come. And I take a good deal of encouragement from the strong
commitment to the poor and marginalized that our new Pope has evidenced
throughout his years as bishop – a commitment that has gone far beyond words
and has come to life in a simple, humble lifestyle worthy of St. Francis of Assisi.</p>
<p>This weekend and in the days ahead, let us give thanks to God for giving us this
new and promising moment in the unfolding history of our Church. And let us
commit ourselves to praying daily for Pope Francis as he assumes his awesome
responsibilities as bishop of Rome and universal pastor.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>TODAY!!! ST. PATRICK’S DAY PANCAKE BREAKFAST</b>.
Today is our first annual pancake breakfast on St.
Patrick’s Day, after the 10:00am and Noon Masses. The
breakfast will benefit our own Solanus Casey Center,
which provides essential services to homeless and low-income
people in the downtown area. The suggested
donation is $5. We are also raffling off some fun St.
Patrick’s Day gifts. Be sure to stop by for this fun parish
event!</p>
<p><b>OUR ELECT DURING LENT</b>. At our 10:00am Mass you
are seeing our newly Elect wear brown robes while
attending Mass and other liturgies during Lent. This
helps them to know, in a concrete way, that they have
entered a new and significant stage in their final
preparations for Easter. It also anticipates another
change that will take place when they emerge from the
baptismal waters at the Easter Vigil and change to white
robes. Seek them out in our midst and, if possible,
introduce yourself to them after Mass. Let them know
you are praying for them and looking forward to Easter
when they will join us at the Eucharistic table.</p>
<p><b>PALM SUNDAY AND EASTER SUNDAY COFFEE HOURS</b>.
Please note that on Palm Sunday, March 24, there will
be no Coffee Hour following the 10:00am mass. Also
Easter Sunday, March 31 we will not be hosting Coffee
Hour after any masses.</p>

beverages except for water, and donate what you saved to your Rice Bowl. Learn more at

<p><b>LENTEN PRAYER PARTNERS FOR THE ELECT</b>. Now is
the time to “adopt” one of our Elect as they prepare to
celebrate the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation and
Eucharist. You are asked to pray every day for him/her
asking for God’s blessings and guidance. Also, notes
and cards will be collected during Holy Week to be
given to the Elect before Easter. Prayer Partner cards
are available at the place of prayer located at the
Baptismal Font where you can also learn more about
each of them in our Book of the Elect. Prayer Partner
cards are also located in the bookstore and in Cathedral
Hall during Sunday morning hospitality. You can also
meet our Elect on <a href="../../Events/2013/elect2013.aspx">our parish website</a>. Your prayers make a
difference!!! <i>Information</i>,
