<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

UNDERSTANDING OF CONCILIAR RECEPTION</b>. On
Thursday, January 24, at 7:00pm at Pigott Auditorium,
Seattle University, you’re invited to continue exploring
the Second Vatican Council. What does it means to say
that an ecumenical council’s teaching has been
“received”? This lecture will explore how a dynamic
understanding of conciliar reception must involve
dialogue, participation, and even “re-invention.” A
member of the IHM Sisters, Mary Ann Hinsdale is an
associate professor of systematic theology at Boston
College. This lecture is free and open to the public.</p>

<p><b>WOULD YOU CONSIDER ASSISTING A PERSON</b> who
wants to become Catholic? We have a number of new
inquirers starting our Christian Initiation process
(RCIA) to learn more about the Catholic Church. We
need St. James parishioners to be companions with
some of our new inquirers to help welcome them to our
community. The time commitment is reasonable–two
Wednesday evening sessions a month. Training and
support are provided. The rewards are many, including
renewal and update of your own faith and “kudos” in
heaven. <i>Information</i>,

setting up, greeting participants, and putting things
away for our weekly RCIA gathering. The time commitment is once a month from 
6:00-9:30pm. It is a great way to meet new people and support an important 
parish ministry. <i>Information</i>,

registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to register</i>.

from the Cathedral, are able to celebrate their wedding
at the Cathedral, and their children may attend any of
the five Catholic Rainbow Schools at parishioner rates.

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I know many of you have been looking forward to
next month’s revival of <i>Great Music for Great
Cathedrals</i>. I was looking forward to it myself!
However, we have had to cancel it because of a
serious injury to his leg that Dr. Jim Savage,
Director of Music, sustained on Christmas Eve. He
is currently making a good recovery from surgery,
but not so good that he will be able to orchestrate
the complex realities of <i>Great Music</i>. We’re
grateful that Jim is able to be with us to direct the
choirs on Sunday. I know you will join me in
praying for his complete recovery!</p>
<p>Father Ryan</p>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Paul in
Seattle and on the Swinomish Indian Reservation, and the
Mission Church of St. Paul in Westport.</p>
