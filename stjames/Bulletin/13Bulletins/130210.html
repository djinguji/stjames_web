<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

	<p><b>WOULD YOU CONSIDER ASSISTING A PERSON</b> who
wants to become Catholic? We have a number of new
inquirers starting our Christian Initiation process
(RCIA) to learn more about the Catholic Church. We
need St. James parishioners to be companions with
some of our new inquirers to help welcome them to our
community. The time commitment is reasonable — two
Wednesday evening sessions a month. Training and
support are provided. The rewards are many, including
renewal and update of your own faith and “kudos” in
heaven. <i>Information</i>,

	<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During January we made 62
home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions allowed us to help 51 individuals and
families pay their rent and stay safely in their
homes. In addition, we provided food for 40
families, beds and furniture for 13 households,
clothes for 4 people, and transportation assistance
for 6 individuals. Our priority is preventing
homelessness. This makes your contributions go a
long way. Helping our neighbors pay their rent is far
cheaper than picking up the pieces after they lose
their homes. Members of the St. Vincent de Paul
Society follow Jesus through service to those in
need. Bearing witness to Christ’s compassionate and
liberating love, we show our commitment through
person-to-person contact, making our home visits in
pairs. Please consider joining our ministry to the
poor among us. <i>Information</i>, Rob Millar 206-954-8902 and Tammy Bendix 206-595-9158.</p>
