<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in memory of
Irene Telmo, from her loving family on the first
anniversary of her death. Flowers are also from the
Saturday wedding of Regina Bourdage and Jack Tucci.</p>
<p><b>CHORAL MUSIC SATURDAY 5:30</b>. We welcome <i>Ave
Renaissance Choir</i>, director Rebekah Gilmore.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO</b>. Please come by after the
10:00 and Noon Masses. All proceeds for the month of
October benefit the Environmental Justice Committee.</p>
<p><b>YOUNG ADULTS “THIRD SUNDAY”</b> On the third Sunday
of every month join other young adults in the parish at
the 5:30pm Mass. We will gather for Mass TODAY,
November 17. After Mass join us for a reception in the
Pastoral Outreach Center on the corner of 9th and
Columbia. Hope to see you there!</p>
<p><b>MASS IN MEMORY OF THOSE KILLED IN TYPHOON
HAIYAN</b>. On Friday, November 22, at 12:10pm,
Archbishop Sartain will offer a special Mass in memory
of the thousands killed in the Philippines in the
catastrophic typhoon. All are welcome. If you would
like to make a donation to the relief effort, Catholic
Relief Services (CRS) is already there, responding to
the immediate emergency need for water, food, shelter
and medical care, and to assist in the long-term
recovery from the disaster. Make a donation at
<a class="navy" target="_bulletin" href="http://www.crs.org">www.crs.org</a>.</p>
<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL CONFERENCES</b> of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During October we made 47
home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions allowed us to help 42 individuals and
families pay their rent and stay safely in their homes. In
addition, we prevented 5 utility shut-offs, provided food
for 32 families, beds and furniture for 14 households,
clothes for 3 people, and transportation assistance for 2
individuals. Our priority is preventing homelessness.
This makes your contributions go a long way. Helping
our neighbors pay their rent is far cheaper than picking
up the pieces after they lose their homes. Please
consider joining our ministry to the poor among us.

Given our ongoing commitment to the Migrant
Project, the Youth Leadership Team is asking for
donations of unwrapped toys for children ages 1-12
and winter clothing items (e.g. socks, gloves, hats,
scarves, jackets, etc.) to help support the Skagit
Valley migrant community during the holiday
season. Our team will personally deliver these items
