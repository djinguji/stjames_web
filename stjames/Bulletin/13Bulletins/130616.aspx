<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James
Cathedral is proud to welcome visitors from
near and far throughout the summer months.
Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will
be made from among all the visitor envelopes used.
Please write your address on the visitor envelope
provided in the pew and drop it with your offering into
the collection basket. Thank you for adding to the
power of our prayer by your presence in our midst
today. <b>Last week, we had visitors from 
Squamish, BC; Eagle River, AK, and San Antonio, TX, and
many other places! The winner of our drawing was
from Houston, TX.
</b></i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from Seattle University in

<p><b>GUEST CHOIRS</b>. Saturday, June 15 at 5:30pm we

<p><b>BE A PART OF CAMINO SEATTLE</b>. The pilgrimage
begins on June 23! Passports can be picked up after all
Masses this weekend—in the Chapel following the
Saturday and Sunday 5:30pm Masses, and at Coffee
Hour following the 8:00am, 10:00am, and 12 Noon
Masses. Souvenir t-shirts are also available for a $10
donation. Our goal is to have 500 parishioners
participate this year! Be a part of it!</p>
<p><b>ANNUAL CATHOLIC APPEAL</b>. The Annual Catholic
Appeal is winding to a close, but we are not there yet!
We are still nearly $80,000 short of our parish rebate
goal of $180,000. We urgently need the rebate to fund
our Family and Youth Ministry programs! Please, if
you have not already done so, make a gift to the Appeal.
Envelopes are in the pews and chairs this weekend, or
you can go online to make your gift,
<a class="navy" target="_bulletin" href="http://www.seattlearchdiocese.org/aca">www.seattlearchdiocese.org/aca</a>. A gift of any size is
welcome.</p>
<p><b>PRIESTS’ DAYS</b>. During the coming week, the priests of
the Archdiocese of Seattle will be at their annual
gathering with the Archbishop in Ocean Shores. During

next week will be at 5:30pm on Monday and Tuesday,
June 17 and 18, and at 8:15am on Wednesday, June 19.
The regular Mass schedule will resume on Thursday,
June 20. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p><b>THE SPIRITUAL EXERCISES IN EVERYDAY LIFE</b> is a
nine month retreat format of the Spiritual Exercises of
St. Ignatius of Loyola, with retreat communities
meeting in Seattle and Tacoma, beginning in September
and running through May. It is a powerful, life-changing
program of prayer and reflection that can be
done by busy people of varied backgrounds and
Christian traditions in the midst of their daily lives. Retreatants commit themselves to praying everyday
(ideally for one hour), meeting twice monthly with a
Spiritual Director, and to attending monthly Saturday
retreat days. <i>Information</i>.

<p><b>YOUTH MIGRANT PROJECT</b>. Attention High School Youth (Grades 9-12)! Are 
you interested in simple living and humble service? Do you desire to learn more 
about the justice issues associated with our local migrant workers? If so, God 
may be calling you to join us on this summer’s Youth Migrant Project in the 
Skagit Valley. July 28 – August 2. We will be sharing our week with St. Luke, 
Shoreline. We have up to 20 slots available. Friends are welcome! <i>Information or

<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL CONFERENCES</b> of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During May we made 78 home
visits to our low income neighbors. Your contributions
allowed us to help 48 individuals and families pay their
rent and stay safely in their homes. In addition, we
prevented 2 utility shut-offs, provided food for 48
families, beds and furniture for 23 households, clothes
for 2 people, a motel room for one person, baby items
for 2 families and transportation assistance for 9
individuals. Our priority is preventing homelessness.
This makes your contributions go a long way. Helping
our neighbors pay their rent is far cheaper than picking
up the pieces after they lose their homes. <i>Information</i>,
Rob Millar 206-954-8902 and Tammy Bendix 206-595-9158.</p>
<p><b>THANK YOU, MAGGIE</b>. For twenty-seven years, one
faithful parishioner has been stuffing all 2,900 of our
parish bulletins single-handedly on Fridays and
Saturdays, counting them out and preparing them for
our weekend Masses. Maggie “the Magnificent” has
recently retired from taking care of the bulletins. A
huge and grateful thank you to Maggie from the entire
parish community! <i>If you would like to volunteer to
help stuff bulletins in the future, contact

<p><b>ST. JAMES YOUNG ADULTS</b> are headed to Safeco Field to watch the Seattle 
Mariners take on the Chicago Cubs for a 7:10pm game on Friday, June 28. We have 
a block of seats reserved for us so it will be a chance to meet new people and 
watch a great ball game with friends. The evening is sure to end on a high note 
as the first ever post-game fireworks show will be happening that evening. 
Tickets are $15 a person. Please contact
<a href="mailto:clanigan@stjames-cathedral.org?subject=St. James Young Adults">

<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight,
and the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect
way to end a busy week.</p>

Gleaners go out in the morning, once a week, usually as partners, to four local 
supermarkets and collect food. These 
items may be used for our daily meals or passed on to St. Mary’s Food Bank. It’s 
a fun and rewarding outreach! <i>Information</i>,
