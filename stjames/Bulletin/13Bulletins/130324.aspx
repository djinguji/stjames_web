<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>PALM SUNDAY AND EASTER SUNDAY COFFEE HOURS</b>.
Please note that TODAY, Palm Sunday, March 24, there

<p><b>PANCAKE BREAKFAST THANK YOU!</b> A huge thank you
to all who joined in the fun of last Sunday’s St. Patrick’s
Day Pancake Breakfast. Thanks to your incredibly
generous support, we greatly surpassed our goal of 50
IDs. We raised $3,583, which will allow our Solanus
Casey Center to provide 79 IDs to our neighbors in need.
A special thanks to the many volunteers—chef, cooks,
servers, decorators, dancers, hosts—who made this event
possible. And save the date for the 2nd Annual
breakfast: Sunday, March 16, 2014!</p>

25% of contributions to CRS Rice Bowl remain in our own diocese, helping to 
support local poverty and hunger alleviation programs. This week, we pray for 
people in our own community who struggle with poverty and hunger. Give to your 
Rice Bowl to support programs that help the poor in our own community, as well 
as in communities around the world. Learn more at

<p><b>OUR ELECT DURING LENT</b>. At our 10:00am Mass you
are seeing our newly Elect wear brown robes while
attending Mass and other liturgies during Lent. This
helps them to know, in a concrete way, that they have
entered a new and significant stage in their final
preparations for Easter. It also anticipates another
change that will take place when they emerge from the
baptismal waters at the Easter Vigil and change to white
robes. Seek them out in our midst and, if possible,
introduce yourself to them after Mass. Let them know
you are praying for them and looking forward to Easter
when they will join us at the Eucharistic table.</p>

<p><b>YOU KNOW THE CATHEDRAL OFFERS ESL, BUT DID
YOU KNOW ESL & ADULT BASIC SKILLS CAN BENEFIT
EVERYONE?</b> Limited English proficiency is often the
biggest obstacle keeping immigrants from securing
better jobs and becoming more active community
members. Providing ESL offers immigrants and
refugees access to job training and higher education
which leads to increased employment and home
ownership rates and reduced healthcare and public
assistance costs. Find out more about the need for ESL
on page 3 of the report, “Why Immigrant Integration is
Good for Everyone” at the Cathedral’s
<a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/ESL">ESL website</a>. Look for the link to
the video where an El Salvadoran mother and a
Tibetan yak herder talk about how learning English has
changed their lives. Information,

CATHOLIC CHURCH AND/OR BECOMING CATHOLIC?</b>
