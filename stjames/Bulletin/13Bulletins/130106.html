<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b>. Please come by after
the 10:00 Mass. All proceeds for the month of January
benefit the St. James ESL Program. The Espresso
Ministry is also looking for volunteers willing to run
the cart after the noon Mass. If you are interested,
please contact Katherine Berry, 425-772-0897.</p>

<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND/OR BECOMING
CATHOLIC?</b> You are invited to participate in RCIA, a
process of initiation into the Catholic community of
faith. It is a process which encompasses the study of
Scripture, Catholic teaching, and Christian values—the
development and deepening of a life of prayer and
action—all with the support and involvement of the
parish community. You can learn more by going to
the <a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA">RCIA 
website</a>. A new inquiry
session will begin Wednesday, January 9, 2013 at 7:00
pm in Cathedral Place, second floor. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>SPIRITUALITY ON TAP: CENTERING PRAYER—FINDING GOD WITHIN OURSELVES</b>. Thursday, January
17, from 7:00-9:00pm, Kathy Heffernan, a certified
chaplain and spiritual director, and young adults ages
21-35 will come together for an evening of reflection
and discussion at St. James Cathedral’s Pastoral
Outreach Center. Centering Prayer is a method of
silent prayer that prepares us to receive the gift of
contemplative prayer, prayer in which we experience
God's presence within us. This method of prayer is
both a relationship with God and a discipline to foster
that relationship. <i>Information</i>,

parishioners who contributed 3,400 pairs of socks to
our 2012 Advent Warm Hearts and Soles sock drive to
benefit the homeless in our city. We thank our
individual donors as well as our generous corporate
donor, the Zumiez Foundation, for helping us exceed
our goal. All are going to organizations we work with
to be distributed to those in need. And many thanks,
too, to young adults who donated their time to collect
socks following the Advent Masses. We are blessed to
have such a caring and generous parish!</p>

<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. For those who wish, babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</p>

<p><b>ARCHBISHOP HUNTHAUSEN LIBRARY</b>. Visit your
friendly and accessible Archbishop Hunthausen Library
in Cathedral Hall during the Sunday coffee hours. We
have a good selection of old favorites and recent
releases.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Mary in
Anacortes and Marysville and St. Elizabeth Ann Seton in
Bothell.</p>
