<p align="center"><b>A SPECIAL NOTE FROM FATHER RYAN</b></p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
	<p>The Super Bowl was great for Seattle but
maybe not quite so great for St. James. Put it
this way: as far as attendance is concerned (we
were down about one-half), it was not such a
Super Sunday for St. James! And the
unexpected snow storm last weekend was a
repeat performance. It’s all very
understandable, of course but, as you know,
parish expenses continue, Super Bowls or
snowstorms notwithstanding! So, please take
this as a gentle reminder to catch up with your
contributions if you happened to miss either of
those weekends. Thank you!</p>

generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
