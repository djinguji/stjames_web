<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in loving memory
of José Banez on the first anniversary of his death, from
Matilde Banez and children.</p>
<p><b>NEW IN THE CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. Hot off the
press! <i>Journey of Faith</i> is a brand-new retelling of the
history of the Church in Western Washington, from the
days when native peoples called this place holy ground,
right up to the present day. This short history (told in
“comic book” or graphic novel format) includes key
moments in the life of our Cathedral. You may even spot
Father Ryan on a page or two! The book is great for all
ages. Paperbound is $10, hardbound $15. Pick up a copy
today. Also: we have plenty of Lenten reading in stock!</p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b> is open! Please
come by after the 10:00 and Noon Masses. All proceeds
for the month of March benefit our ministries to the
homeless.</p>
<p><b>NO TAIZE THIS FRIDAY</b>. Due to the Rite of Election on
Friday, March 7, there will be no Taizé Prayer this
Friday. The service will resume on Friday, March 14 at
6:30pm. We apologize for the inconvenience. Thank you
for understanding!</p>
<p><b>VOLUNTEERS NEEDED FOR THE PANCAKE
BREAKFAST</b>. We are looking forward to celebrating St.
Patrick’s Day with all of you! Please consider helping
us as a volunteer at this year’s Pancake Breakfast. We
