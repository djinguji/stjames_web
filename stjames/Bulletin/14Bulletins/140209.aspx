<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I am happy to be able to share with you the wonderful news that at
the beginning of February, a new pipe organ will be installed along the east
wall of the Cathedral chapel. The organ is a gift to the Cathedral from Carol
Robl and the Robl family, and it was built by Frank Robl, Carol’s wonderful
husband, a devoted parishioner of this Cathedral for many years, who died
last year at this time.</p>
<p>Frank was an extraordinary man. He had amazing human gifts—the
disciplined, analytical mind of a skilled engineer and the artistic tastes of a
Renaissance man. His interests were endless and encyclopedic. There were
few things Frank couldn’t do, few things he couldn’t figure out. He not
only learned to play the organ, he figured out how to build one!</p>
<p>The organ we will be receiving was in Frank and Carol’s home for
many years but I find it altogether fitting that it will now find a home in St.
James Cathedral. It will be but one more of Frank’s ‘fingerprints’ in this
place—along with the handsome wooden signboards at each of the
entrances of the Cathedral, the beautiful replica of a medieval chant stand
on which we place an icon each Sunday at the beginning of Mass, and the
processional crucifix that we use every year during Advent and Lent.</p>
<p>I am grateful beyond words to Carol and each of the Robl children:
Frank, Jr., Chris, and Andrea, for making it possible for yet one more of
Frank’s works of art to find a home in St. James Cathedral. I know you will
join me in praying for them and for their family.</p>
