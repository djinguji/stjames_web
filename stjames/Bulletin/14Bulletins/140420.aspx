	Easter Sunday, 2014</td></tr></table>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>It is a joy to welcome you to St. James Cathedral on this Easter of 2014. I do so in
the name of our Archbishop, J. Peter Sartain, as well as in my own.</p>
<p>Of all the times we gather as Christian believers, none is more important than Easter
— the greatest of all our feasts. Easter celebrates the Mystery that is the very foundation
of our Christian faith, for, as St. Paul wrote, “If Christ has not risen, our faith is in vain”
(1 Cor. 15:14). But Christ has risen and your presence here in the Cathedral today both
affirms and celebrates that most amazing and enduring of all realities! While we do not
see him, we know he lives and we know that he is in our midst breathing life and hope
into us, walking alongside us on our pilgrimage of faith, our journey toward the Kingdom
of God.</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing what is in your heart as you come here on this Easter
Sunday. For some, I am sure, there is joy and a keen sense of hope for the future as
Spring with its promise of new life is bursting forth all around us. For others, there may
be the burden of pain and sadness that comes from a serious illness, a family crisis, the
death of a loved one, or the loss of a job. For still others, this may be the Easter that you
have decided to get more serious and intentional about the practice of your Catholic
faith — or at least to explore that possibility. If so, good for you! And I can’t help but
suspect that Pope Francis and the fresh air he is breathing into the Church may have
something to do with that!</p>
<p>Whatever your situation, I hope that Easter of 2014 brings you a measure of joy and
peace as well as a renewal of your faith in Christ risen.</p>
<p>And whether you have come here today in joy or sadness, hope or uncertainty, I
want you to know how welcome you are. And I hope that you will find here at St. James
Cathedral something that will comfort you, challenge you, and lift you up. We live in a
world that, while incredibly beautiful, is also seriously flawed. Death and life are never
very far away from us, are they? But Easter boldly proclaims that death is not the end of
the story. Easter proclaims for all to hear that Life always gets the last word, not death!</p>
<p>My prayer today is that you will be renewed in faith and hope as you celebrate
Easter at St. James Cathedral. If you are a visitor, please know that we warmly welcome
you and hope that you will return soon — maybe even to become part of this amazing and
vibrant community of faith! And if you are already part of the parish family of St.
James, I take this opportunity to thank you for all the ways in which you make the Risen
Lord Jesus present in this parish and in this city day after day: through your prayer,
your faith, and your love that overflow in generous and unselfish service to the poor.</p>
<p>May the blessings of the Risen Lord Jesus be yours in abundance.</p>

A<span style="font-variant: small-caps">rchdiocese of</span> S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">eattle</span> and its Archbishop, the Most
Reverend J. Peter Sartain. We are also a parish church for a vibrant faith community with a
long history that reaches back to Seattle’s early days.</p>
<p>We are an inner-city parish with an outreach to many who live on the edge of poverty and
loneliness. We are a diverse community that welcomes, accepts, and celebrates the differences
we all bring. We exist in the heart of the city, yet sometimes our parishioners come from
considerable distances to worship here.</p>
<p>St. James Cathedral is a crossroads where ideas and challenges both old and new are explored
in the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Our Cathedral is also the center for many cultural
and ecumenical events which both reflect and help to shape a vital metropolitan community.</p>
<p>Above all, St. James Cathedral is a community of prayer.</p><hr>
