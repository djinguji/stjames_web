<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>

<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL CONFERENCES</b> of St. James
thank Cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During December we made 64
home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions allowed us to help 42 individuals and
families pay their rent and stay safely in their homes. In
addition, we prevented 6 utility shut-offs, provided food
for 44 families, beds and furniture for 20 households,
clothes for 2 people, and transportation assistance for 5
individuals. Our priority is preventing homelessness.
This makes your contributions go a long way. Helping
our neighbors pay their rent is far cheaper than picking
up the pieces after they lose their homes. Please
consider joining our ministry to the poor among us.

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of Holy Redeemer
in Vancouver and Sacred Heart in LaConner and Winlock.</p>
