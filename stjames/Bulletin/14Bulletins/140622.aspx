<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>St. James Cathedral is proud to welcome visitors from near 
and far throughout the summer months. Each week a drawing for a special 
Cathedral gift will be made from among all the visitor envelopes used. Please 
write your address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and drop it with 
your offering into the collection basket. Thank you for adding to the power of 
our prayer by your presence in our midst today. </i> </p>

<p><b>GUEST CHOIR SATURDAY 5:30PM</b> We welcome Peregrine
Vocal Ensemble, Bill McJohn, director.</p>

<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in loving memory of
Bryan James Henderson from his family.</p>

<p><b>CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE&nbsp; </b>Reclaimed: This Catholic Faith is Mine!, a 
new book by our own parishioner and Cathedral Choir member Gregory Phillips, is 
now available. Also, we have James Martin, SJ’s new book Jesus: A Pilgrimage in

<p><b>ANNUAL CATHOLIC APPEAL</b> As Father Ryan reminded us
last weekend, we have now met the goal set for us by the
Archbishop for this year’s Annual Catholic Appeal. But
we are still $110,401 short of reaching our goal for the
parish rebate. And 68% of our parish households have
not yet responded. If you have not yet made a gift, please
consider doing so today. The need is urgent as we rely on
the rebate to meet our expenses as a parish. This year’s
rebate will support our outreach ministries as well as our
new ministry to young adults. To make your pledge online,
visit www.seattlearchdiocese.org/aca.</p>

<p><b>RICE BOWL RESULTS </b> This Lent, we surpassed the entire
Archdiocese in donations to the Rice Bowl. You donated
$19,061.26, an increase of 31% from last year! Thank you
for your extraordinary generosity to the poorest in our
world. A special thanks to all the children who
participated. You made a difference!</p>

<p><b>MASS FOR DECEASED BISHOPS</b> This Thursday, June 26,

Murphy, we remember in prayer the shepherds who have
led the Archdiocese of Seattle through the years. Auxiliary
Bishop Eusebio Elizondo will preside. All are welcome.</p>

<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN&nbsp; </b>would like to thank Horizon
House for their donations of sandwiches and green salads.

greater, especially over the summer holidays! Please

Health and Healing Ministry, will be Sunday,
