<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><b>DIVINE MERCY CELEBRATION</b>. Sunday, April 27 is
Divine Mercy Sunday. This year, we have special
reason to celebrate God’s mercy as we mark the
canonization of two Popes of recent times: John XXIII
and John Paul II. Following the 12 Noon Mass,
Cathedral young people will lead the Divine Mercy
chaplet, a favorite devotion of John Paul II. Mass will
be followed by a special reception in Cathedral Place
Hall, with foods from around the world, and egg
decorating and games for kids. All are welcome.</p>
<p><b>FIRST FRIDAY EXPOSITION AND HOLY HOUR</b>. This
coming Friday, May 2, Exposition will begin at 12
Noon with the Holy Hour, because of a special Mass
with O’Dea High School in the morning. We
apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL KITCHEN GARDEN</b>. Spring is here, and
we’re underway with planting in our new Cathedral
Kitchen Garden. We are still looking for volunteers to
help with planting, weeding, watering, and other tasks.

and a great way to meet people. To volunteer, contact

changes as we age, and how to recognize changes that
may signal a problem. The more you know about
memory and how it works, the better equipped you’ll
be to recognize a problem if it arises. Tuesday, May 13,
2014 at 7:00, Cathedral Place. <i>Information</i>,
