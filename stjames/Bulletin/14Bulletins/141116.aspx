<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from Edgar Telmo, in
loving memory of his mother Irene Telmo on the
second anniversary of her death.</p>
<p><b>THE ESPRESSO MINISTRY</b> welcomes you at coffee
hour after the 10:00am Mass! This month, all sales will
benefit the Cathedral Kitchen.</p>
<p><b>WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE SISTERS DOING TODAY?</b>
On Sunday, November 16, after the 10:00am Mass, you
are invited to the Rectory Parlors for a presentation by
Sisters of the Holy Names Anne Herkenrath, Judy
Ryan, Lydia Nikolaisen and SNJM Associate, Sue
Wildermuth. How are Sisters and their lay Associates
living the Call of the Gospel and responding to the
needs of God’s People today? Come with your
questions for a lively dialogue.</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Each November our bulletin covers feature
the names of parishioners and friends who
over the past twenty-five years remembered
St. James Cathedral in their will. Each of those
names is a person, of course, and each person
had a story, and each story, in one way or
another, involved St. James Cathedral!</p>
<p>Some of their legacy gifts were large; others
were the proverbial widow’s mite; still others
were somewhere in the middle. But each gift
made a difference: each gift helped to keep the
Cathedral afloat – helped us fulfill our mission
– over these many years.</p>
<p>Every November, I take time to read those
names with care and as I do, I see familiar
faces and call to mind wonderful stories. And
I pray for each of those generous people,
giving thanks to God for them. I hope you
will do the same. We wouldn’t be what we
are without them!</p>
<p>Father Ryan</p>
