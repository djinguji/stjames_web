<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><b>IN THE CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. Now in stock: <i>Jesus:
A Pilgrimage</i>, a new book by Father James Martin, SJ.
Also, a new book by our own Archbishop Sartain: <i>A
Journey to the Heart of Jesus</i>. And don’t miss <i>Journey of
Faith</i>, a brand-new retelling of the history of the Church
in Western Washington, from the days when native
peoples called this place holy ground, right up to the
present day. This short history (told in “comic book” or
graphic novel format) includes key moments in the life
of our Cathedral.</p>
<p><b>PALM SUNDAY AND EASTER SUNDAY COFFEE HOURS</b>.
Please note that on Palm Sunday, April 13, there will be
no Coffee Hour following the 10:00am Mass. On Easter
Sunday, April 20, we will not be hosting Coffee Hour
after any Masses.</p>
<p><b>NOTES FOR ELECT PRAYER PARTNERS</b>. Did you
“adopt” one of our Elect preparing for baptism at the
Easter Vigil as a prayer partner this Lent? Please drop
off notes and cards in the designated receptacle in the
north aisle, or you can drop them off at the Parish
Office during business hours.</p>
<p><b>HOLY THURSDAY RICE BOWL PROCESSION</b>. A
reminder to bring your Rice Bowl with you this
Thursday evening at 6:00pm for the Evening Mass of
the Lord’s Supper. You will be invited to bring it
forward to the altar in the gifts procession during the
solemn Holy Thursday Mass.</p>
<p><b>DIVINE MERCY CELEBRATION</b>. Sunday, April 27 is
Divine Mercy Sunday. This year, we will have special
reason to celebrate God’s mercy as we mark the
canonization of two Popes of recent times: John XXIII
and John Paul II. Following the 12 Noon Mass,
Cathedral young people will lead the Divine Mercy
chaplet, a favorite devotion of John Paul II. Mass will
be followed by a special reception in Cathedral Place
Hall, with foods from around the world, and egg
decorating and games for kids. All are welcome.</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES KNITTERS GROUP</b> meets Monday, April 14
from 6:30pm to 8:00pm in the Fireside Room, Pastoral
Outreach Center. We get together the second Monday
of the month to knit or crochet hats and scarves for the
homeless. Newcomers are always welcome. We’ve
taught others to knit, and will help you, too. This
month, expert knitter Connie Carlson will show us how
to knit in the round with two circular needles. Bring
two circulars, both the same size, and some yarn for
practice. Or just bring your knitting and join the fun.
<i>Information</i>, Connie Carlson, 206-518-1623.</p>
<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL CONFERENCES</b> of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During March we made 61 home
visits to our low income neighbors. Your contributions
allowed us to help 28 individuals and families pay their
rent and stay safely in their homes. In addition, we
provided food for 32 families, beds and furniture for 15
households, clothes for 6 people, and transportation
assistance for 11 individuals. Our priority is preventing
homelessness. This makes your contributions go a long
way. Helping our neighbors pay their rent is far cheaper
than picking up the pieces after they lose their homes.
Members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society follow
Jesus through service to those in need. Bearing witness
to Christ’s compassionate and liberating love, we show
our commitment through person-to-person contact,
making our home visits in pairs. Please consider joining
our ministry to the poor among us. <i>Information</i>, Rob
Millar, 206-954-8902 and Tammy Bendix, 206-595-9158.</p>
<p><b>GALLAGHER CENTER MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCE
ROOM</b> open every Sunday 9am-2 pm. Enjoy
refreshments while you browse through literature, talk
with nurse and volunteers, and connect with others.
<i>Note that the resource room will be closed on Easter
Sunday, April 20</i>.</p>

we’re underway with planting in our new Cathedral
Kitchen Garden. We are still looking for volunteers to
