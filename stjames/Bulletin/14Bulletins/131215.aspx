<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL CONFERENCES</b> of St.
James thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During November we made 46
home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions allowed us to help 29 individuals and
families pay their rent and stay safely in their homes. In
addition, we prevented 2 utility shut-offs, provided
food for 38 families, beds and furniture for 16
households, clothes for 5 people, and transportation
assistance for 2 individuals. Our priority is preventing
homelessness. This makes your contributions go a long
way. Helping our neighbors pay their rent is far cheaper
than picking up the pieces after they lose their homes.
Members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society follow
Jesus through service to those in need. Bearing witness
to Christ’s compassionate and liberating love, we show
our commitment through person-to-person contact,
making our home visits in pairs. Please consider joining
our ministry to the poor among us. <i>Information</i>, Rob
Millar 206-954-8902 and Tammy Bendix 206-595-9158.</p>

cathedral parishioners serve as overnight hosts and
breakfast cooks. We are currently in need overnight

Please consider joining our Winter Shelter Team. There
is a commitment of volunteering once a month.
