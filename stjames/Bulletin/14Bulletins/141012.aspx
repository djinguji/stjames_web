<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>This past week, Jim Savage, Cathedral Music Director for the past
thirty-three years, announced his decision to retire from his position early in
the New Year.</p>
<p>The decision could not have been an easy one for Jim to make, and it
certainly wasn’t an easy one for me to receive. I’m sure this will be true for
you as well, considering the truly magnificent job Jim has done over these
many years, making incredibly beautiful music in this place, teaching and
inspiring more than a generation of choristers, and helping us as a
community of believers to raise our voices in joyful praise of God.</p>
<p>And Jim’s gifts have not been confined to St. James Cathedral. Far
from it! In one way or another, every parish in this Archdiocese has gained
from his extraordinary leadership and so have parishes and cathedrals across
this country. It is not overstating things to say that Jim has become a legend
in his own time.</p>
<p>Finding a way to thank Jim will be as difficult as finding his successor.
I know I can count on your prayers as we take the all-important steps
regarding the future leadership of the Cathedral music program. I will keep
you informed as things develop in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>There is so much more to say, and so much to celebrate, too, but for
now, let me simply say that Jim Savage’s accomplishments as Director of
Music have been nothing short of phenomenal. His legacy will be an
enduring one. Please join me in praying for Jim as he prepares for the next
lap on his remarkable journey of life and faith.</p>
