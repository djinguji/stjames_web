<p><b>ANNUAL CATHOLIC APPEAL</b> Thanks to some
wonderfully generous gifts this past week, we are now
just $22,017 short of reaching our goal for the parish

rebate to meet our expenses as a parish. This year’s

ministry to young adults. To make your pledge online,

Cathedral School of Christ the King Cathedral in
Bungoma, Kenya, and to provide needed repairs to the
Cathedral roof. Your generosity will make a big
difference.</p>
