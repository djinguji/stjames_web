wedding at the Cathedral, and their children may attend

<p><b>BAPTISM OF INFANTS and YOUNG CHILDREN</b> (under the
age of 7) is celebrated monthly at one of the weekend
Masses. To prepare for this most important sacrament,
parents and godparents must participate in a series of
classes to update their understanding of baptism, to
reflect on their responsibility to guide their children in
the practice of the faith, and to learn about the many
ways our parish supports families. Please allow at least
two months for preparation. Information, Margaret
Lynch, mlynch@stjames-cathedral.org.</p>
