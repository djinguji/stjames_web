		<p><b>BUILDING AND MAINTAINING HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS</b>: This workshop 
		is intended for individuals who struggle with relationships. Whether you 
		want to build a healthier relationship with your partner or learn how to 
		identify the red flags of a “bad” relationship, this presentation is for 
		you! The workshop allows attendees to explore and evaluate their own 
		relationships and learn new skills to develop and maintain healthy 
		relationships. Topics that will be covered in this workshop include: how 
		early relationships affect adult relationships, what are the red flags 
		of a bad relationship that often get missed, identifying important 
		values in a partner, setting boundaries, and what a healthy relationship 
		looks like. Presentation is geared towards romantic relationships, but 
		principles can be generalized and applied to friendships and families. 
		Tuesday, June 3 7pm, Pastoral Outreach Center. Presenter: Dr. Kathleen 
		King, PhD, LMHC.</p>
