<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><b>GUEST CHOIR SATURDAY 5:30 MASS</b>. We welcome
Peregrine Medieval Vocal Ensemble, conducted by Bill
McJohn.</p>
<p><b>CRS COLLECTION</b>. This weekend we take up our annual
collection to support Catholic Relief Services. Since
1943, CRS has been the Catholic Church in America’s
main agency for providing relief to victims of war and
natural disasters as well as providing development and
support services for the disadvantaged throughout the
world. On behalf of the countless people who rely on
the outreach of Catholic Relief Services, thank you for
your generosity.</p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b> is open! Please
come by after the 10:00 and Noon Masses. All proceeds
for the month of March benefit our ministries to the
homeless.</p>
<p><b>IN THE CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. Now in stock: <i>Jesus:
A Pilgrimage</i>, a new book by Father James Martin, SJ.
Also, a new book by our own Archbishop Sartain: <i>A
Journey to the Heart of Jesus</i>. And don’t miss <i>Journey of
Faith</i>, a brand-new retelling of the history of the Church
in Western Washington, from the days when native
peoples called this place holy ground, right up to the
present day. This short history (told in “comic book” or
graphic novel format) includes key moments in the life
of our Cathedral.</p>
<p><b>GALLAGHER CENTER MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCE
ROOM</b> open every Sunday 9-2 pm. Enjoy refreshments
while you browse through literature, talk with nurse and
volunteers, and connect with others. <i>Note: we will be

<p><b>PRAYERS TO OUR LADY OF LOURDES</b>. The men and
women of the Order of Malta will be going on
pilgrimage to the healing shrine of Lourdes in southern
France this May. They will take with them intentions
from local parishes, which will be remembered at the
Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes. Stop by the Shrine of
the Blessed Virgin Mary today or any time during the
next week, write your petition on the form provided,
and drop it in the box of intentions.</p>

RETREAT</b>. On Saturday, April 12 from 9:00am-11:00am in Cathedral Place Hall, you are invited to join
in a retreat led by parishioner Patty Repikoff. Where
would Pope Francis’ vision lead us if we were to take it
to heart? to our homes, to our streets? As we prepare to
celebrate Holy Week and Easter, this will be a welcome
time of prayer and reflection. The retreat marks the
conclusion of our Lenten discussion series on <i>Joy of the
Gospel</i>, but is open to all. Please mark your calendar
and come even if you have been unable to be part of the
Lenten small study groups!</p>

James parish community. We are already looking
forward to next year!</p>

This week, CRS Rice Bowl invites us to enter into solidarity with the people of 
Malawi. We are

God sanctifies and calls us to work. Let us pray this
week for our brothers and sisters in Malawi and all
around the world, that we work with joy for God’s
greater glory. Learn more about the work of
