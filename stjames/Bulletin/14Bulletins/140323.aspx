<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>

history of the Church in Western Washington, from the

<p><b>STATIONS OF THE CROSS</b>. The unique Stations of the
Cross are the work of Cathedral iconographer Joan
Brand-Landkamer. They were inspired by the work of
20th-century French artist Georges Rouault. The
stations were created from found objects which
Landkamer collected near her home in Ocean Shores.
Each station is unique, and together they form a stark
and intensely moving portrayal of the last journey of
Jesus.</p>
<p><b>PRAYING THE STATIONS</b> is a wonderful Lenten tradition in the Church. 
There are three opportunities to pray the Stations each week: on Mondays 
following 12:10pm Midday Prayer, Wednesdays following the 5:30pm Mass, and 
Fridays following the 8:15am Mass (except First Fridays). You can also pray the 
stations <a target="_bulletin" href="../../Prayer/jkblstations/stations.htm">online</a>.</p>
