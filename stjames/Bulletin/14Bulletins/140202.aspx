<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I am happy to be able to share with you the wonderful news that at
the beginning of February, a new pipe organ will be installed along the east
wall of the Cathedral chapel. The organ is a gift to the Cathedral from Carol
Robl and the Robl family, and it was built by Frank Robl, Carol’s wonderful
husband, a devoted parishioner of this Cathedral for many years, who died
last year at this time.</p>
<p>Frank was an extraordinary man. He had amazing human gifts—the
disciplined, analytical mind of a skilled engineer and the artistic tastes of a
Renaissance man. His interests were endless and encyclopedic. There were
few things Frank couldn’t do, few things he couldn’t figure out. He not
only learned to play the organ, he figured out how to build one!</p>
<p>The organ we will be receiving was in Frank and Carol’s home for
many years but I find it altogether fitting that it will now find a home in St.
James Cathedral. It will be but one more of Frank’s ‘fingerprints’ in this
place—along with the handsome wooden signboards at each of the
entrances of the Cathedral, the beautiful replica of a medieval chant stand
on which we place an icon each Sunday at the beginning of Mass, and the
processional crucifix that we use every year during Advent and Lent.</p>
<p>I am grateful beyond words to Carol and each of the Robl children:
Frank, Jr., Chris, and Andrea, for making it possible for yet one more of
Frank’s works of art to find a home in St. James Cathedral. I know you will
join me in praying for them and for their family.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>

<p><b>BACK BY POPULAR DEMAND!</b> Mental Health First Aid

individuals understand and respond to signs of mental
illness and substance use disorders. Learn a simple 5
Step Action Plan to help an individual in crisis.
Comments from an attendee of recent MHFA training:
“I found it very informative and helpful. I found the
tools very specific, how to approach a disturbed person
and when X happens, do Y. That is very helpful to
persons who aren't trained in how to handle individuals
with mental health problems.” Scholarships to cover
$100 cost available for King County residents through
