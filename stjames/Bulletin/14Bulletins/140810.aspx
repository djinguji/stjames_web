<p><b>FAITH FORMATION FOR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL
NEEDS</b> We are delighted to launch a new ministry for
children with special needs in the fall. Children will have
the opportunity to meet one-on-one with a teen faith
mentor from our Youth Ministry every Sunday morning
during the faith formation hour. This allows for
individualized faith instruction and ensures full inclusion
in our parish community. This model was developed by
Deacon Larry Sutton, a psychologist who specializes in
autism who will provide training for our youth and
families. To register your child, please contact Theresa
Van de Ven at tvandeven@stjames-cathedral.org. To
volunteer as a teen faith mentor, please contact Joe
Cotton at jcotton@stjames-cathedral.org.</p>

their closing informal concert, Friday, August 15 at
