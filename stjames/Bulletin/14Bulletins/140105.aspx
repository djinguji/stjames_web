<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>With this new year of 2014 comes a new moment in our religious
education department -- a new director. You may recall that TerryAnn
Bowen, who held this position for two years, stepped down last fall in order
to pursue doctoral studies. Since then, Patty Bowman and Corinna
Laughlin have ably directed the program and I am extremely grateful to
them for a job well done. Now, following a national search, we are ready to
welcome our new director, Kathleen McCabe. However, as those of you
who have been parishioners here for some time will know, ‘new’ doesn’t
quite fit Kathleen because she served as our director of religious education
from 1997-1999! I know you will join me in welcoming her back to St.
James.</p>
<p>For me, Kathleen’s return is a gift from God. She and her husband,
Jerome, and their three children left here fourteen years ago so Jerome could
pursue doctoral studies at the Catholic University of America in
Washington, DC. Since then, she has ministered at parishes in Northern
Virginia and in the Boston area. Kathleen brings with her a strong faith,
excellent credentials for teaching and administration, a buoyant spirit,
infectious enthusiasm, many years of valuable experience, and a love for St.
James that never dimmed over the years she was away from us. The RCIA,
adult faith formation, and Welcome Back programs will, I am confident,
thrive under her capable leadership. Welcome home, Kathleen McCabe!</p>

		<p><b>GOOD NEWS FROM YOUTH MINISTRY</b>. Following
an extremely successful toy and clothes drive,
organized by Youth Leadership Team members,
our youth traveled to the Skagit Valley on
December 21. They unloaded and arranged an
impressive array of toys and clothes for migrant
children. Our youth then took each migrant child by
the hand and helped them select some toys. Then,
they they outfitted child after child with new
jackets, scarves, and gloves. Almost every child
went home with a hand-knit hat, courtesy of our
cathedral knitting community. All in all, over 250
migrant children visited the food bank, each of
them receiving multiple gifts. There was such an
abundance, the children were often able to take
extra items home to their parents. Many thanks to
all the youth members who gave up a Saturday
during their Christmas break to reach out to the
poor. This is what the Gospel looks like!</p>

<p><b>HIGH SCHOOL YOUTH NIGHTS</b>. Every Sunday
evening from 6:30 – 8:30pm in the Pastoral
Outreach Center. Join us for interactive games and
activities that will challenge you to apply your faith
to everyday life. All are welcome!</p>
		<p><b>JUNIOR HIGH SOJOURN</b>. We are launching a
biweekly gathering for middle school youth
(Grades 7 & 8) that will help young people explore
who they are, what they’re about, and what role
God and faith will play in their lives. Please e-mail
Joe to “vote” for a day of the week and time frame
that would be ideal for you.</p>
