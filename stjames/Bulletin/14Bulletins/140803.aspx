Conception Church. At each stop, there will be a short
tour of the space and time for exploration and quiet

during the faith formation hour. This allows for
individualized faith instruction and ensures full inclusion
in our parish community. This model was developed by
Deacon Larry Sutton, a psychologist who specializes in
autism who will provide training for our youth and
families. To register your child, please contact Theresa
Van de Ven at tvandeven@stjames-cathedral.org. To
volunteer as a teen faith mentor, please contact Joe
