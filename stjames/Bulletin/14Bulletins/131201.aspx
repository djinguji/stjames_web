<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><b>THE ALTAR ARRANGEMENT</b> is offered in loving
memory of Joaquin Arreola and Bernando Bapena,
from their family.</p>
<p><b>ADVENT IN THE CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. Stop by the
Cathedral Bookstore for a wide array of resources for
Advent, including Cathedral Christmas Cards, Advent
candles, rosaries, medals, and more!</p>
<p><b>MEDIEVAL ART OF SUSAN BONDURANT</b>. Susan
Bondurant returns to the Cathedral Chapel this Advent
with a new show of her recreated medieval book
illuminations. “The medieval period,” Bondurant
writes, “was a world much like our own: a world of
both progress and savagery, ideology and science, and
above all, rapid change. Through illuminations,
medieval artists expressed their sense of expectation
and hope for a better and more beautiful world.” Stop
by the Cathedral Chapel to view these works from
November 30 through December 20.</p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN WOULD LIKE TO THANK</b> <b>Pagliacci Pizza</b> for providing, preparing and serving a
generous meat loaf dinner and baked desserts on
Thursday, November 21. You helped the Cathedral
Kitchen serve over 170 guests and we are very grateful
for all that you do to serve our many guests. We also
thank <b>Horizon House</b> for preparing and donating a
freshly made green salad Thursday, November 14.
Your salad was delicious and served many dinner
guests that evening.</p>
<p><b>ADVENT IN MEDIEVAL ENGLAND</b>. Saturday, December
7, 8:00 pm Blue Heron, the Boston-based a cappella
ensemble, has been hailed by the New Yorker as the
American “heir apparent” to the Tallis Scholars. The
ensemble of ten singers and early harp makes its Seattle
debut with a program of carols, motets and plainchant
from 15th-century England, featuring music by Leonel
Power, John Dunstaple, English carols, and Sarum
plainchant.
