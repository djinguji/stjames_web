whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>It’s wonderful to be able to share with you
that you were your usual generous selves in
responding to the collection last weekend in
support of the victims of the terrible landslide
in Snohomish County. To date, you have
contributed $14,010! I know this will make a
big difference for the people up there. We
have sent a check in that amount to Father Tim
Sauer, the pastor of Immaculate Conception
parish in Arlington. Anyone who would still
like to make a donation can do so by dropping
a check in the collection basket, made out to St.
James Cathedral with “Oso” on the memo line.
Thank you!</p>
