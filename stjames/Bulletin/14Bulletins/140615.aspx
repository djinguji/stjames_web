<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>St. James
Cathedral is proud to welcome visitors from
near and far throughout the summer months.
Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be
made from among all the visitor envelopes used. Please
write your address on the visitor envelope provided in
the pew and drop it with your offering into the collection
basket. Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer
by your presence in our midst today. Last weekend, we
welcomed visitors from Cerritos, CA; Lahaina, HI;
and Greensboro, NC. The winner of our drawing was
from Norfolk, VA.</i> </p>

<p><b>GUEST CHOIR SATURDAY 5:30PM</b> We welcome the choir of Holy
Trinity Lutheran Church, Mercer Island, directed by

<p><b>CELEBRATION OF MINISTRIES DINNER</b> Our annual
celebration is this coming Thursday, June 19. If you are
volunteer in a ministry here at the Cathedral, but did not
receive an invitation (they were sent by e-mail or snail
mail), please let us know. You are still welcome!

<p><b>ANNUAL CATHOLIC APPEAL</b> We have now met the
$337,040 goal set for us by the Archbishop for this
year’s Annual Catholic Appeal. Every dollar donated
at this point will come directly back to the parish in the
form of a rebate. And we need the rebate, which will
support our outreach ministries as well as our new
ministry to Young Adults. Our goal for the rebate is
$200,000. Right now, we are still $135,000 short of
reaching it--and only 29% of our households have turned in a pledge! 
If you haven’t yet turned in your pledge, please
consider doing so today!</p>

<p><b>YOUNG ADULTS “THIRD SUNDAY”</b> On June 28, we
will put our softball skills to good use! Volunteers are
needed to teach girls how to play softball and baseball;
both men and women are encouraged to sign up. There
will be 2 groups of around 25 girls and you will lead them
in warm ups, drills and skills and then facilitate a noncompetitive
game. Volunteers also receive discounted
entrance to the Northwest African American Museum. For
only $2 you can check out the Pitch Black exhibit,
exploring African American baseball in the Northwest.
Also, THERE WILL BE ICE CREAM TRUCKS! To sign
up to volunteer, e-mail Caitlin Lanigan, clanigan@stjames
-cathedral.org call 206-382-4235 by June 18.</p>

<p><b>ARE YOU A REGULAR AT THE SATURDAY 5:30PM
MASS?</b> If you regularly attend the Saturday evening
Mass, please consider getting involved as a liturgical
minister. We are especially in need of communion
ministers. Confirmed Catholics who are registered in
the Cathedral parish are encouraged to consider this
important ministry. Training and preparation are

<p><b>SEEKING DONATIONS FOR OUR HUNTHAUSEN DINNER
AND AUCTION</b> This annual event benefits the Cathedral
Kitchen, raising thousands of dollars each year. Last
year, we raised $99,000! The event will take place
Monday, September 15, at the Newcastle Golf Club.
We are seeking auction items such as dinner gift
certificates, event tickets (cultural or sporting events),
and bottles of wine. If you have something you’d like to

like to register for the dinner, visit www.stjamescathedral.

<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN BECOMING CATHOLIC?</b> If
you are an adult who has never been baptized, an adult
who has been baptized in another Christian tradition or
a Catholic who has been baptized, but not received First
Eucharist or Confirmation then you are invited to
participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the
Catholic Church. You can learn more by going to
www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA. Information,
Kathleen McCabe, 206-382-2018, kmccabe@stjamescathedral.
org.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU A CATHOLIC WHO HAS BEEN AWAY FROM
THE CHURCH?</b> Our Welcome Back program provides a
safe place, in the company of others who are also
examining their faith, to ask questions about returning
to regular church attendance, returning to the
sacraments, and to learn about changes in the church.
The classes are held on Monday evenings from 7pm –
9pm in Cathedral Place. Information, Kathleen
McCabe, 206-382-2018, kmccabe@stjamescathedral.

<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL CONFERENCES</b> of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During May we made 67 home
visits to our low income neighbors. Your contributions
allowed us to help 45 individuals and families pay their
rent and stay safely in their homes. In addition, we
provided food for 34 families, beds and furniture for 9
households, as well as clothes, household items and
transportation assistance. Our priority is preventing
homelessness. This makes your contributions go a long
way. Helping our neighbors pay their rent is far cheaper
than picking up the pieces after they lose their homes.
Members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society show their
commitment through person-to-person contact, making
our home visits in pairs. Please consider joining our
ministry to the poor among us. Information, Rob Millar
206-954-8902 and Tammy Bendix 206-595-9158.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially
registered. We strongly encourage you to register.
Registered parishioners receive important mailings from
the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are
regular recipients of the Cathedral’s twice-yearly
journal In Your Midst, are able to celebrate their
wedding at the Cathedral, and their children may attend
any of the five Catholic Rainbow Schools at parishioner
rates. Registration cards can be found in the vestibule. If
you are not sure whether or not you’re registered, call
the Parish Office, 206-622-3559</p>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we are the 
Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass and Vespers each of the parishes 
and missions of the Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day. This
week we remember in prayer the communities of Holy Spirit
in Kent, Sacred Heart in Seattle, Bellevue, and Morton; St.
Anthony in Renton and St. Anthony Mission in Carnation; and
St. Aloysius in Buckley. </i>.
