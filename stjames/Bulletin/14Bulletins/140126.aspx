we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>

<p><b>GOSPEL NONVIOLENCE</b>. What does the Gospel teach

the Gospel basis for nonviolence, as well as explore
applications of Gospel nonviolence to contemporary
situations. Thursday, January 30, 7:00 pm, Pastoral

<p><b>BACK BY POPULAR DEMAND!</b> Mental Health First Aid
(MHFA) Workshop, Saturday, February 22, 8:30am–
4:30pm. This is an informational program to help
individuals understand and respond to signs of mental
illness and substance use disorders. Learn a simple 5
Step Action Plan to help an individual in crisis.
Comments from an attendee of recent MHFA training:
“I found it very informative and helpful. I found the
tools very specific, how to approach a disturbed person
and when X happens, do Y. That is very helpful to
persons who aren't trained in how to handle individuals
with mental health problems.” Scholarships to cover
$100 cost available for King County residents through
NAMI. <i>Information</i>,
