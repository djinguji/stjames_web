<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>St. James
Cathedral is proud to welcome visitors from
near and far throughout the summer months.
Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be
made from among all the visitor envelopes used. Please
write your address on the visitor envelope provided in
the pew and drop it with your offering into the collection
basket. Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer
by your presence in our midst today. </i> </p>

<p><b>GUEST CHOIR SATURDAY 5:30PM</b> We welcome the
Middle School Choir of Forest Ridge School of the
Sacred Heart, Alison Seaton, director.</p>

<p><b>MUSIC FOR PENTECOST 10:00 SUNDAY</b> will feature
improvisations on the chants for Pentecost by the
world-renowned saxophonist, Michael Brockman.</p>

<p><b>GIFT-BEARERS THIS SUNDAY</b> Throughout the school
year we have a group of dedicated parishioners who
give their Sunday mornings to help our parish children
grow in their faith and deepen their relationship with
Jesus. This Sunday we honor and show appreciation to
the wonderful volunteers in Children’s Faith
Formation (CFF) as they represent us in the assembly
by bringing up the gifts. Thank you, dear Catechists,
Assistants and Welcome Team, for another CFF year
graced with your self-gift!</p>

<p><b>ANNUAL CATHOLIC APPEAL</b> We have now met the
$337,040 goal set for us by the Archbishop for this
year’s Annual Catholic Appeal. Every dollar donated
at this point will come directly back to the parish in the
form of a rebate. And we need the rebate, which will
support our outreach ministries as well as our new
ministry to Young Adults. Our goal for the rebate is
$200,000. Right now, we are still $175,000 short of
reaching it! A follow up mailing goes out next week.
If you haven’t yet turned in your pledge, please
consider doing so today!</p>

<p><b>ST. JAMES KNITTERS GROUP</b> meets Monday, June 9
from 6:30pm to 8:00pm in the Fireside Room, Pastoral
Outreach Center. Last month, we got a huge stash of
yarn donated, and we're looking for help in turning it
into hats and scarfs for the homeless. All knitters and
crocheters are welcome. We are happy to teach
beginners. Want to join in on the fun? Please join us on
the second Monday of the month. Information, Connie
Carlson, 206-518-1623.</p>

<p><b>THE NEXT SENIOR TRIP</b> will be Wednesday, June 11.
First we will visit the Appel Dairy Farm in Ferndale
for a guided tour of the milking parlor and the cheese
making facilities. Our second stop will be Fairhaven
on the south side of Bellingham. Well known for its
relaxed atmosphere, Fairhaven enjoys a variety of local
arts and crafts and really good eateries. Please join us!
Space is limited and priority will be given to registered
parishioners. Information, or to reserve your place,
John Simpson, Pastoral Care Minister, at 206-274-
3173 or jsimpson@stjames-cathedral.org.</p>

<p><b>CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE&nbsp; </b>Reclaimed: This Catholic
Faith is Mine!, a new book by our own parishioner and
Cathedral Choir member Gregory Phillips, is now
available. Visitors, stop by for a CD, mug, postcard, or
other souvenir of your visit to St. James Cathedral!</p>


<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b> Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight, and
the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect way
to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN BECOMING CATHOLIC?</b> If
you are an adult who has never been baptized, an adult
who has been baptized in another Christian tradition or
a Catholic who has been baptized, but not received First
Eucharist or Confirmation then you are invited to
participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the
Catholic Church. You can learn more by going to
www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA. Information,
Kathleen McCabe, 206-382-2018, kmccabe@stjamescathedral.
org.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU A CATHOLIC WHO HAS BEEN AWAY FROM
THE CHURCH?</b> Our Welcome Back program provides a
safe place, in the company of others who are also
examining their faith, to ask questions about returning
to regular church attendance, returning to the
sacraments, and to learn about changes in the church.
The classes are held on Monday evenings from 7pm –
9pm in Cathedral Place. Information, Kathleen
McCabe, 206-382-2018, kmccabe@stjamescathedral.
org.</p>
<p><b>FLORAL DONATIONS</b> Floral donations are a wonderful
way to remember a deceased loved one or
commemorate an important anniversary, and at the
same time enrich the whole parish community! If you
would like to offer flowers, contact Jane Mueller, 206-
654-4650 or e-mail jmueller@stjames-cathedral.org.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially
registered. We strongly encourage you to register.
Registered parishioners receive important mailings from
the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are
regular recipients of the Cathedral’s twice-yearly
journal In Your Midst, are able to celebrate their
wedding at the Cathedral, and their children may attend
any of the five Catholic Rainbow Schools at parishioner
rates. Registration cards can be found in the vestibule. If
you are not sure whether or not you’re registered, call
the Parish Office, 206-622-3559</p>
