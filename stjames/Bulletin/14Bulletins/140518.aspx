<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know 
how welcome you are — whether you have come from another part of the country, 
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. 
Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to 
celebrate the Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also 
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people living in the central 
district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. A CD of the remarkable Tre Ore talks by Rev. Dr. 
Michael Kinnamon is available for a small fee. Also, statues of St. Francis for 
your garden, a new book by Father Jim Martin, SJ, and much more!</p>

<p><b>ECUMENICAL ICON OF THE RESURRECTION</b>. This weekend, St. James Cathedral 
is privileged once again to host a beautiful icon of Christ’s Resurrection. The 
icon, written by Yakov Prokofiev of St. Petersburg, was commissioned by the St. 
Petersburg Seattle Sister Churches Board to celebrate the 20th anniversary of 
their program, which encourages friendly relations between churches in Seattle 
and St. Petersburg. The icon was blessed by Metropolitan Vladimir and brought to 
Seattle in the summer of 2011. During this Easter Season, it travels around the 
Pacific Northwest to churches of many Christian denominations.</p>
<p><b>CHRISTIAN BROTHERS CELEBRATION</b>. Next Sunday, May 25, at the 10:00am 
Mass, we will pray in a special way for and with the Christian Brothers, who 
have staffed O’Dea High School for 91 years. The last resident brothers are 
leaving Seattle this June, and while O’Dea will continue to carry on the legacy 
of Christian Brothers’ education, their presence will be greatly missed. Please 
mark your calendar to come and pray with the Brothers next Sunday.</p>

		<p><b>BUILDING AND MAINTAINING HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS</b>: This workshop 
		is intended for individuals who struggle with relationships. Whether you 
		want to build a healthier relationship with your partner or learn how to 
		identify the red flags of a “bad” relationship, this presentation is for 
		you! The workshop allows attendees to explore and evaluate their own 
		relationships and learn new skills to develop and maintain healthy 
		relationships. Topics that will be covered in this workshop include: how 
		early relationships affect adult relationships, what are the red flags 
		of a bad relationship that often get missed, identifying important 
		values in a partner, setting boundaries, and what a healthy relationship 
		looks like. Presentation is geared towards romantic relationships, but 
		principles can be generalized and applied to friendships and families.
