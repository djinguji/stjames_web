<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>

join us! Space is limited and priority will be given to
registered parishioners. <i>Information, or to reserve your

		Dear Friends,<p>I know you will want to join me in welcoming <b>Rosanne 
		Michaels</b> back to our pastoral team. Some of you will remember her 
		fondly from the years she ministered here with us (1995-2006). She 
		rejoins the staff now to head up our aAdult Confirmation program as well 
		as our program for “returning Catholics” (Welcome Back!). In addition, 
		Rosanne will work with Suzanne Lee in various aspects of Family 
		Ministry, including baptismal preparation. And, given Rosanne’s wide 
		scope of interests, I suspect she will be making her mark in other areas 
		of parish life, too! Please join me in welcoming Rosanne Michaels back
