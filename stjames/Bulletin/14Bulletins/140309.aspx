<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I am sorry not to be here this weekend to personally welcome our
guest homilist and presider, Fr. Bryan Dolejsi. Fr. Dolejsi is the director of
vocations for the Archdiocese and a very effective one.</p>
<p>I feel a real kinship with him since I served as director of vocations for
the archdiocese way back in ancient history (1970-1977)! It was an important
ministry then; it’s even more important now -- one that involves raising
awareness among parishioners of the great need for vocations to the
priesthood and the religious life (brothers and sisters), helping potential
candidates to discern their calling over a period of years, and working with
the parishes to help them assume their responsibility with regard to priestly
and religious vocations.</p>
<p>And that’s where we come in! Vocations to the priesthood and
religious life don’t drop from the heavens! They come from families like
yours and from parishes like ours. I am happy to say that during my years
here at St. James, twelve men from our parish have entered seminaries or
religious formation programs, and five of them are now serving as priests,
four here in Seattle and one in Spokane. And three of those twelve are still
in the formation programs of religious orders. Of course I wish the number
were larger, but I am grateful that it’s as large as it is, and that those five
priests are as good as they are!</p>
<p>Fr. Dolejsi’s presence here this weekend will, I know, energize you
and serve as a strong reminder that God calls forth priests, brothers, and
sisters from communities like ours – prayerful communities that are strong
in faith and committed to serving the poor. Knowing this should encourage
us to be the best parish we can possibly be. I also hope that his message will
resonate with some of our young people who may be wondering if God is
calling them to serve as priests or religious, and that it will encourage them
to step forward and make themselves known. I know Fr. Dolejsi will be
happy to make himself available to them and so will I! Lastly, I hope we will
all be reminded this weekend how important it is to do as Jesus told us,
“pray the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers into the harvest.”</p>
<p>I am away this weekend on my annual retreat, something I always do
at the beginning of Lent. I know I can count on your prayers and I trust you
know how grateful I am for them.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>

press! <i>Journey of Faith</i> is a brand-new retelling of the
history of the Church in Western Washington, from the
days when native peoples called this place holy ground,
right up to the present day. This short history (told in
“comic book” or graphic novel format) includes key
moments in the life of our Cathedral. You may even spot
Father Ryan on a page or two! The book is great for all
ages. Paperbound is $10, hardbound $15. Pick up a copy
today. Also: we have plenty of Lenten reading in stock!</p>

purchase a breakfast ticket for one of our low-income
guests. Tickets will be available next weekend as well
but we encourage you to buy today to avoid the lines
next weekend! Join us for pancakes next Sunday after
the 10:00AM and Noon Masses and help us raise
money for Solanus Casey Center. If you have
forgotten, Solanus Casey is a drop-in day center for our
homeless and low-income neighbors. The Center is
staffed by volunteers and a paid director who help those
in need of assistance obtaining identification cards,
prescription drugs, bus passes, a cup of coffee, a
listening ear and so much more!</p>
