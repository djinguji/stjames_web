<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>St. James Cathedral is proud to welcome visitors from near 
and far throughout the summer months. Each week a drawing for a special 
Cathedral gift will be made from among all the visitor envelopes used. Please 
write your address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and drop it with 
your offering into the collection basket. Thank you for adding to the power of 
our prayer by your presence in our midst today. </i> </p>

<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in honor of Brandy
Sales, on her 18th birthday, from her family.</p>

<p><b>CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE&nbsp; </b><em>Reclaimed: This Catholic Faith is Mine!</em>, a 
new book by our own parishioner and Cathedral Choir member Gregory Phillips, is 
now available. Also, we have James Martin, SJ’s new book <em>Jesus: A Pilgrimage </em>in 
stock.  Visitors, stop by for a CD, mug, postcard, or other souvenir of your visit 
to St. James Cathedral!</p>

<p><b>ANNUAL CATHOLIC APPEAL</b> As Father Ryan reminded
us last weekend, we have now met the goal set for us by
the Archbishop for this year’s Annual Catholic Appeal.
But we are still $70,032 short of reaching our goal for
the parish rebate. And 65% of our parish households
have not yet responded. If you have not yet made a gift,
please consider doing so today. The need is urgent as we
rely on the rebate to meet our expenses as a parish. This
year’s rebate will support our outreach ministries as well
as our new ministry to young adults. To make your
pledge online, visit www.seattlearchdiocese.org/aca.</p>

<p><b>LOURDES WATER&nbsp; </b>Back by popular demand! Members of
the Order of Malta will be here after all Masses this
weekend to share vials of Lourdes water which they have
brought back from their recent pilgrimage for Cathedral
parishioners. Lourdes water flows from the spring which
was pointed out to St. Bernadette in one of the
apparitions of Mary at Lourdes in 1851. It is normal
water, not holy water, and may be drunk or used as a
bath. This water has been associated with countless
healings over the years, but, in the words of St.
Bernadette, “you have to keep the faith and pray : this
water couldn't do anything without faith!”</p>

<p><b>SUMMER ICON SERIES</b> Do you wonder what the picture
is that is carried in at the beginning of Mass? Come to the
Chapel directly after the 10:00am Mass or 12:00 Noon
Mass on July 6 and July 13 to find out. We will explore
the icons of Saints Peter and Paul, the Triumphal Entry
and St. James. Each session will last 15 minutes.
