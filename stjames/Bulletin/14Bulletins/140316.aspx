<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><b>NEW IN THE CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. Hot off the
press! <i>Journey of Faith</i> is a brand-new retelling of the
history of the Church in Western Washington, from the
days when native peoples called this place holy ground,
right up to the present day. This short history (told in
“comic book” or graphic novel format) includes key
moments in the life of our Cathedral. You may even spot
Father Ryan on a page or two! The book is great for all
ages. Paperbound is $10, hardbound $15. Pick up a copy
today. Also: we have plenty of Lenten reading in stock!</p>
<p><b>FATHER RYAN’S TALK ON POPE FRANCIS</b> is again
available for a nominal fee in the Cathedral Bookstore.
If you missed the talk, or if you want to share it with
friends, stop by the bookstore today to pick up a copy.
(Apologies that we sold out so early last week!)</p>

<p><b>LENTEN HOLY HOUR</b> is each Friday during Lent, from

<p><b>OPERATION RICE BOWL</b>. This week, CRS Rice Bowl
invites us to enter into solidarity with the people of

Responsibilities, and reminded that as Christians, we
are called to uphold and protect the basic rights of
others. Let us pray this week for our brothers and sisters
in Guatemala and all around the world, that we may
come to know and protect the rights of all people. Learn

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Our second annual St. Patrick’s Day
Pancake Breakfast is today (after the 10:00am
and Noon Masses). The breakfast is a
fundraiser for our own wonderful Solanus
Casey Center, so the cause is a great one. (As
you know, the Solanus Casey Center is our
drop-in center for homeless people and people
in crisis.) But, cause or no cause, the pancake
breakfast is a wonderful opportunity to enjoy
the company of some of the best people
around – your fellow parishioners!</p>
<p>I’m sorry to have to miss it this year. But
that will leave more pancakes for you. Enjoy!</p>

week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Patrick in
Seattle and Tacoma, and St. Patrick Mission in Dockton. </p>
