<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.

the Santo Niño, the Holy Child Jesus. The image of
Jesus as vulnerable child and mighty King is beloved
throughout the world, and in a special way in the
Philippines. All are invited to bring their own images
of the Child Jesus from home for the blessing. The
annual celebration will be followed by a fiesta in
Cathedral Place Hall, with dancing, a raffle, and, of
course, a marvelous feast of Filipino food prepared by
a group of our own parishioners. All are welcome.</p>

the day. The study will finish in time to attend 5:30
Mass. Young adults over the age of 21, single or
married, gather in the Fireside Room of the Pastoral
Outreach Center. Newcomers and those not new to the
parish are all welcome! <i>Information</i>

<p><b>AND THE GOOD NEWS GOES ON…</b> Cathedral Kitchen
has been tremendously blessed this holiday season. As
you know, Thanksgiving was a beautiful affair, but it
didn’t stop there. Many generous men, women,
students and families shared with our guests an
overwhelming amount of love and care this season. As
the Wise Men did with their gifts, PEMCO volunteers
brought and prepared an outstanding roast beef dinner
with all of the trimmings; families from Christ the
King Parish and St. Anthony Church brought beautiful
little treasure bags filled with winter gloves, candy,
cookies and treats; and one of our weekly volunteers
representing the Baptist and Pentecostal Churches
brought a Soul Food menu for our New Years dinner.
None of us will ever be the same. We thank you, and
thank God.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially
registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to register</i>.
Registered parishioners receive important mailings
from the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are
regular recipients of the Cathedral’s highly acclaimed
journal <i>In Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate their
wedding at the Cathedral, and their children may attend
any of the five Catholic Rainbow Schools at
parishioner rates (and become eligible for Cathedral
scholarships). In addition, if you are a registered
parishioner and use envelopes, or are on the direct
deposit program, we will mail you a quarterly report of
your contributions to the parish. Registration cards can
be found in the vestibule. <i>If you're not sure whether
you're registered at St. James, call the parish office at
206-622-3559</i>.</p>
<p><b>REST IN PEACE</b>. Please pray for the repose of the soul
of Sally West, mother of Helen Oesterle.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>.
This week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Mary
in Anacortes and Marysville, and Immaculate Heart of
Mary in Kelso.</p>
