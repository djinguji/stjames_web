<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.

now available. This year’s edition is the work of our
own Director of Liturgy, Corinna Laughlin, and choir
chaplain, Ward Johnson. Be sure to pick up your copy

<p><b>YOUNG ADULTS “WARM HEARTS AND SOLES”</b>. 6th
annual Advent sock drive for homeless men starts today,

toward the goal of 2,010 pairs for delivery in January
2010. Drop off new socks at the Young Adult table in
Cathedral Hall after 8:00am, 10:00am, and 12:00
Sunday Masses in Advent, or during the week at 2nd

keep those hearts and soles warm this winter!

<p><b>HELP A SENIOR IN NEED</b>. Many in our community are in need of help with 
transportation, shopping, laundry, housework, and more. Age, illness, economics, 
and disabilities can all be barriers to accomplishing these routine, daily 
tasks. By volunteering just a few hours a month, you can make a huge difference 
in someone’s life, provide them peace of mind, and help them stay in their own 
home rather than going to an institutionalized setting. If you are interested in 
joining this rewarding ministry, please come to the orientation in the Mother 
Cabrini Room, Pastoral Outreach Center on Tuesday, December 1 at 6:30pm. <i>
