<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.

<p><b>SOLEMNITY OF MARY, MOTHER OF GOD</b>. Masses for
the Holy Day are Thursday, December 31 at 5:30pm
and Friday, January 1 at 8:00am, 10:00am, and 12

than by praying for peace in the world in the company
of our Blessed Mother?</p>

<p><b>NEW YEAR’S EVE BENEFIT DINNER</b>. Are you looking
for something fun and sane to do on New Year’s Eve?
Why not attend a benefit dinner right here at St. James
Cathedral, to be followed by the gala New Year’s Eve
Concert, and dessert with the musicians? This is a
warm, festive evening and a delicious dinner in the
Community Room at the Pastoral Outreach Center.
The event (now in its fourth year!) raises funds to
support the Cathedral’s ministries of education and the
arts. The cost is $150 per person. <i>Information</i>,

will continue to collect socks until Epiphany on January
3. Drop off new socks at the Young Adult table in
Cathedral Hall after 8:00am, 10:00am, and 12:00
Sunday Masses, or during the week at 2nd floor
Cathedral Place. Many, many thanks! <i>Information</i>

much. Many years of blessing on St. James.”</p>

<p><b>FUNERAL PLANNING</b>. Many people have questions
regarding funerals—questions ranging from the
Church’s position regarding cremation and burial to
how and when funerals are scheduled and celebrated in
the Cathedral. Since the time of the death of a loved
one is likely to be very emotionally draining, it is
clearly not the best time for dealing with such
questions. In an effort to help parishioners be prepared
ahead of time, the Cathedral offers a simple guide, available at our 
<a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/funerals">parish website</a>. 
This information is also in a booklet that may also be
obtained by calling the parish office.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>.
This week we remember in prayer the parishes of Holy
Innocents Mission in Duvall; Holy Family in Auburn,
Kirkland, and Seattle; Holy Family Mission in Frances;
and Prince of Peace Mission in Belfair.</p>
