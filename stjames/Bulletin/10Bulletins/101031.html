<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Next weekend we will have our annual Ministries Fair in the Cathedral Hall
following the Masses. I hope you’ll plan ahead so you can stay for a few minutes
after Mass. It’s important for you to see for yourself the incredible array of
wonderful things that are going on around here 24/7. If you think you know St.
James simply because you come to Sunday Mass, think again! This year the Fair will
also be held after both the Saturday and Sunday evening Masses. (Pizza will be
served!) Please do plan to come!</p>
<p>We’ve been playing “musical rooms” in the Rectory of late. Father Tom
Marti, the Maryknoll priest who lived here the past few years and occasionally
helped out on weekends, has been named the director of the local Maryknoll House
over on Capitol Hill. He moved out on October 1st – just in time for us to get his
room ready for Father Dick Ward who moved in this past week. Many of you will
remember Father Ward from ten or more years ago when he served as an associate
pastor here. Father Ward is now retired but is looking forward to living here again
and to doing some ministry. He won’t be generally (and generously) available in the
ways he was years ago, but you will see him around and I know you’ll enjoy having
him here, as I will. Many thanks, Father Marti; welcome home, Father Ward!</p>
<p>This week you will find in the bulletin our Annual Report for this past fiscal
year. Our registered parishioners will also receive a copy at home. We mail the
report in addition to publishing it here in the bulletin because we have found that—for 
a variety of reasons—simply putting something in the bulletin doesn’t necessarily
mean it gets to the majority of our parishioners on any given weekend. My hope is
that you will take some time to read the report and reflect on it. There is some
important — and challenging — information in it that touches each one of us as
parishioners of St. James.</p>
<p>Since the appointment of Archbishop J. Peter Sartain as our new archbishop,
we have had a special place of prayer for him in the Cathedral, near the Cathedra
(bishop’s chair). For weeks, many of you have been stopping there to pray and to
light a candle. This week, we have added a book in which you can write directly to
him, letting him know of your prayer and support as he prepares to assume some
pretty weighty responsibilities as our new archbishop. My hope is that you will
write messages or prayers <i>to or for him</i> (not personal intentions for yourselves or your
families). We plan to present him with this book when he arrives at the beginning of
December. Do stop by when you can, to offer a prayer and write a message to
Archbishop Sartain. I know he will be grateful.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b> are in memory of Ruth
Marianne Greenbaum from her daughter Marianne Maxin

for a prayer that has been answered. If you have been inspired to give thanks 
with flowers, please contact </i>
