<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I’m happy to be able to report to you that the 14th annual Archbishop
Hunthausen Golf Tournament at Inglewood Country Club was a great success.
More than 110 golfers participated this year and had a terrific time. The weather
could have cooperated a bit more but this is Seattle, after all! The dinner after the
tournament—which has become a wonderful social event for a lot of parishioners—
drew more than 180 people. Heartfelt thanks to Maria Laughlin and Jeff Meder who
worked so hard to make it a great event. The funds raised that day will help support
the Cathedral Kitchen which, as you must know, is in greater demand than ever
during these days of slow economic recovery.</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to be able to welcome Suzanne Lee to our Cathedral staff.
Suzanne joined us late in August and is working closely with Patty Bowman in our
social outreach ministries. She and her husband Brian Lynch have been
parishioners here for several years and, while relatively new to ministry here at the
Cathedral, she is anything but new to church ministry. For four years Suzanne
served as a pastoral minister at Our Lady of Fatima parish in Magnolia and, before
that, she served on the staff of Catholic Community Services as Director of
Advocacy. When you have had an opportunity to meet her and work with her you
will know why I am delighted that she has joined our ministerial team. Welcome,
Suzanne!</p>
<p>The other day, Patty Bowman and I received a very nice letter from some 15
people of the SHARE Safe Haven Shelter who have been using the Cathedral Hall
for overnight shelter all summer long. Since you are really the ones who have
offered hospitality to them, I thought I would quote their letter in part: “The first
and most important thing that we, the residents of the Safe Haven Shelter can say is
Thank You. We greatly appreciate the time that we stayed in the Cathedral Hall. If
not for your kindness, we would have had to sleep outside. Not only did we feel
safe and secure, but you made us feel welcome in a very large way with just your
acceptance of us in the first place. From leaving us doughnuts, to learning our
names, the people at St. James made us feel welcome. We are grateful.”</p>
<p>Lastly, in case you notice that I’m not here the next couple of Sundays it’s only
because it’s time for some vacation. I’ll be traveling in France with my sisters and
brother-in-law, celebrating my sister Judy’s 50th jubilee as a Sister of the Holy
Names. Should be fun. <i>Au revoir!</i></p>
