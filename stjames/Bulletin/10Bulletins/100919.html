		Dear Friends,<p>The announcement this past week that
Pope Benedict has appointed Bishop J. Peter
Sartain, formerly Bishop of Joliet, Illinois, as
our new Archbishop is wonderful news for
this local church. I know you will want to join
me in praying for him as he prepares to
assume the awesome responsibilities that will
be his. Pray, too, for Archbishop Brunett as he
prepares to step aside after leading this church
for nearly 13 years.</p>
<p>May the Holy Spirit continue to guide our
Church during these days of transition!</p>
