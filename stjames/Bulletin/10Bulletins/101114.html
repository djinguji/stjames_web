<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

wedding of Michelle Lim and Ben Woyvodich.</p>

Kitchen</i>. If you are interested in becoming a Cathedral
barista, please call Sean and Katherine Berry at 206-571-6868. Training is provided!</p>
<p><b>STOP BY THE CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b> after Mass
today and pick up a Sunday Missal for the coming
liturgical year. Books, gifts, and much more!</p>
<p><b>WELCOME, ARCHBISHOP SARTAIN</b>. Since the
appointment of Archbishop J. Peter Sartain as our new
archbishop, we have had a special place of prayer for him
in the Cathedral, near the Cathedra (bishop’s chair). We
have added a book in which you can write directly to him,
letting him know of your prayer and support as he
prepares to assume weighty responsibilities as our new
archbishop. We plan to present him with this book when
he arrives at the beginning of December. Please stop by
to offer a prayer and write a message to Archbishop
Sartain.</p>

<p><b>NEED PASTORAL CARE?</b> The Cathedral provides a

<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at 6:30
pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an

the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect way
to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>WELCOME, PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN</b>. We
support all of our parishioners who are attending Mass
with young children and we welcome those children
into our midst. If you find that your child needs a quiet
place away from the stimulation of the Mass, please feel
free to step into the west vestibule or the cathedral
chapel, where we have provided a sound system so that
you can continue to participate in the Mass. We
appreciate your effort to be with us and to include your
child in our worship. <i>Please note that babysitting is
available in the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral
Outreach Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon
Masses</i>.</p>
