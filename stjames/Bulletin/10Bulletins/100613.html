<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I want to take this opportunity to thank each one of you who has contributed
to the Annual Catholic Appeal. As always, your generosity is quite amazing.
During difficult economic times you have dug deep and taken us closer to
achieving our combined Archdiocesan and parish goal of $470,330. I am more
grateful than words can express. And to those of you who are in a position to
but who have not yet made a gift, I would encourage you to do so. There’s still
time!</p>
<p>Deacon David Olsen, who served as our sacristan for three years and who
took a regular turn preaching at weekend Masses has been asked by the
Archdiocese to assume a new ministry among the Native American
communities of Snohomish County. I am happy that he will have this new
opportunity for diaconal ministry and I know he will bring many blessings to
the people he serves, but I am also very sorry to see him and his wife Reeny
leave St. James. Like you, I will miss David’s calming, peaceful presence and his
insightful and challenging homilies. This weekend, during the hospitality
following the morning Masses, you will not only have a chance to participate in
the Health Fair, but also an opportunity to greet David , to sign a parish “card”
for him, and to thank him for his ministry here at St. James. David, our prayers
accompany you on this new chapter of your journey of faith and service!</p>
<p>And one more thing to share with you: after nearly 20 years serving as my
assistant, Kay Kaiser has made the difficult decision to retire. As you can
imagine, this is a happy moment for Kay but a difficult moment for me as well
as for the parish. There is no way I can begin to calculate how many lives Kay
has touched over her years of service here: how many people she has touched
by her warmth and kindness, how many people she has patiently helped over
the phone and in person, how many ruffled feathers she has smoothed, how
many appointments and interviews she has scheduled for me, how many parties
and receptions she has planned and hosted, and the list could go on and on.
Chances are, you are one of the countless people Kay has helped over the years.
If so, I know you will take time to say a special prayer of thanks for her and a
prayer, too, that her well-deserved retirement will be everything she hopes for.</p>
