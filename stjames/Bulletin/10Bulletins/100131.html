<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.

issue which impacts all of us and we encourage you to participate in the 
campaign. To learn more visit the

<p><b>MARCH BOOK GROUP SELECTION: <i>WHAT IS THE WHAT</i></b>. Join us on Tuesday, March 23 for a discussion
of <i>What is the What</i> by Dave Eggers. Valentino Achak
Deng, real-life hero of this engrossing epic, was a
refugee from the Sudanese civil war. Separated from
his family when Arab militia destroy his village,
Valentino joins thousands of other "Lost Boys" on their
march to squalid refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya.
He eventually reaches America, but finds his quest for
safety, community and fulfillment in many ways even
more difficult. Eggers gives Valentino an unaffected,
compelling voice and makes his narrative by turns
harrowing, funny, bleak and lyrical. Available in the
Cathedral Bookstore. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>HELP A SENIOR IN NEED</b>. Over 100 people in our
community are on a waiting list for help with
transportation, shopping, laundry, housework, and
more. Age, illness, economics, and disabilities can all
be barriers to accomplishing these daily tasks. By
volunteering just a few hours a month with Volunteer
Chore Services, you can make a difference in
someone’s life. Interested in joining this rewarding
ministry? Come to an orientation on the 2nd floor of
the Pastoral Outreach Center on Monday, February 1 at
6:30pm. <i>Information</i>

<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30 pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight,
and the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé
in France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect
way to end a busy week.</p>

<p><b>FUNERAL PLANNING</b>. Many people have questions
regarding funerals—questions ranging from the
Church’s position regarding cremation and burial to
how and when funerals are scheduled and celebrated in
the Cathedral. Since the time of the death of a loved
one is likely to be very emotionally draining, it is
clearly not the best time for dealing with such
questions. In an effort to help parishioners be prepared
ahead of time, the Cathedral offers a simple guide, available at our 
<a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/funerals">parish website</a>. 
This information is also in a booklet that may also be
obtained by calling the parish office.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME, PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN</b>. We
support all of our parishioners who are attending Mass
with young children and we welcome those children
into our midst. If you find that your child needs a quiet
place away from the stimulation of the Mass, please
feel free to step into the west vestibule or the cathedral
chapel, where we have provided a sound system so that
you can continue to participate in the Mass. We
appreciate your effort to be with us and to include your
child in our worship. <i>Please note that babysitting is
available in the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral
Outreach Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon
Masses</i>.</p>
