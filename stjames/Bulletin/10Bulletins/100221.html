<p align="center"><font face="Papyrus" size="5">JOURNEY OF THE ELECT</font></p>
<p>Beginning this week, our newly Elect are wearing
brown robes while attending Mass and other
liturgies during Lent. This helps them to know, in
a concrete way, that they have entered a new and
significant stage in their final preparations for
Easter. It also anticipates another change that will
take place when they emerge from the baptismal
waters at the Easter Vigil and change to white
robes. Seek them out in our midst and, if possible,
introduce yourself to them after Mass. Let them
know you are praying for them and looking
forward to Easter when they will join us at the
Eucharistic table.</p>
<p><b>LENTEN PRAYER PARTNERS FOR THE ELECT</b>. This is the time to “adopt” one 
of our Elect as they prepare to celebrate the sacraments of Baptism, 
Confirmation and Eucharist. You are asked to pray every day for him/her asking 
for God’s blessings and guidance. Also, notes and cards will be collected during 
Holy Week to be given to the Elect before Easter. Prayer cards are available at 
the place of prayer located in the north aisle of the west nave of the Cathedral 
(where you can also learn more about each of them in our Book of the Elect), in 
the bookstore, and in Cathedral Hall during Sunday morning hospitality. You can 
also <a href="../../Events/2010/elect2010.htm">meet our Elect</a>. Your prayers make a
difference!!! <i>Information</i>

our journey with Catholic Relief
Services’ Operation Rice Bowl, let us pray and sacrifice
so that through our faith life we can make a difference
in the lives of our brothers and sisters in need.
