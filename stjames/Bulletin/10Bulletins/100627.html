<p><b>WELCOME, PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN</b>. We
support all of our parishioners who are attending Mass
with young children and we welcome those children
into our midst. If you find that your child needs a quiet
place away from the stimulation of the Mass, please feel
free to step into the west vestibule or the cathedral
chapel, where we have provided a sound system so that
you can continue to participate in the Mass. We
appreciate your effort to be with us and to include your
child in our worship. Please note that babysitting is
available in the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral
Outreach Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon
Masses.</p>
