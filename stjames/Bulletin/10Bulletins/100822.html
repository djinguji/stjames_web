<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Let me share some good news with you. Our little campaign to raise
funds to re-pad and reupholster the kneelers on the Cathedral chairs was
more than successful. As of this writing, thanks to the generosity of more
than 230 of you, and thanks to two very large gifts, we exceeded our goal by
several thousand dollars! The work will be done sometime in the fall,
certainly before Christmas. I’m going to get down on my knees to thank
God for the wonderful way you came through on this—and, no, I won’t be
waiting till the new kneelers are installed!</p>
<p>Speaking of generosity: last week we took up a spontaneous collection for
the relief of the 20 million flood victims in Pakistan. You contributed more
than $8,800 as you left the Cathedral. An amazing response, to say the least,
and an eloquent testimonial to the depth of your concern for people in need.
The money has been forwarded to Catholic Relief Services where it will
make a difference for a lot of suffering people. Thank you for always being
there when it counts.</p>
<p>In mid-September we will be saying good-bye to Jennifer Ibach who has
served with Patty Bowman for the past three years in our social outreach
ministries. Jennifer has done a marvelous job in coordinating our Winter
Shelter as well as our Volunteer Chore Ministry. She has also done wonders
with the Youth Migrant Project, each year getting more young people
involved. She has more than made her mark in the area of social advocacy,
too. Jennifer has decided to complete her graduate program in theology. I
know you will join me in wishing her well in this and in thanking her for her
leadership, enthusiasm, and inspiration. We will miss you, Jenn!</p>
<p>Lastly, in July we welcomed Peggy Behnken as our receptionist and office
manager. We are delighted to have her. If you have occasion to visit or call
the parish office, I know you will be pleased with the welcome you receive
and that you will enjoy getting to know her. Welcome to St. James, Peggy!</p>
