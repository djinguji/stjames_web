<p><b>CARE FOR ALL CREATION</b>. In his recent message for
the World Day of Peace, Pope Benedict stated: “Man’s
inhumanity to man has given rise to numerous threats
to peace and to authentic and integral human
development – wars, international and regional
conflicts, acts of terrorism, and violations of human
rights. Yet no less troubling are the threats arising from 
the neglect – if not downright misuse – of the earth and
the natural goods that God has given us.” How can we
live out our call to be good stewards of creation?
Explore the church’s teaching on the environment and
explore some possible responses by joining us for Care
for All Creation, a six-week series of prayer, education,
Catholic Social Teaching, analysis, discussion, and
signs of hope and action. Monday evenings at 7:00
pm, beginning February 15. Registration required no
later than February 8. <i>Information or to register</i>,

<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH?</b> You are invited to

teaching, and Christian values—the development and deepening of a life of prayer 
and action—all with the support and involvement of the parish community. A new 
inquiry session began on January 13. Wednesday evenings 7:00 to 9:00 pm.
