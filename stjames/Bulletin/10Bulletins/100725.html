<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I am writing this early in the week and already I am hearing some long-range
weather forecasts that are predicting rain. Well, if it comes, we will
deal with it but I don’t think it’s going to. When you read this you’ll know
whether my optimism was warranted! In any case, I know we’ll have a
great celebration. And I know you’ll want to join me in thanking Trent
Mummery and Stephen Pace, and their team of more than fifty (!)
volunteers, for making this great event possible.</p>
<p>We’re doing a very low-key fundraiser today. The kneelers on the
chairs in the Cathedral are now 16 years old and the padding on them is
pretty much non-existent. (If you sit in the chairs you don’t need me to tell
you this!) It’s going to cost approximately $22,000 to reupholster 600
kneelers—about $40 per kneeler. If you’re in a position to help, we would
be most grateful!</p>
<p>It is wonderful to be able to celebrate the feast of St. James with all of
you. It was on this day 22 years ago that I was installed as Cathedral
pastor by Archbishop Hunthausen, and celebrated the Feast of St. James
with this community for the first time. In some ways, that seems like a
long, long time ago to me; in other ways, it feels like yesterday! Over these
years you have let me lead you in prayer and Eucharist and you have let
me be your teacher and your companion on the great journey of faith.
People sometimes ask me what my greatest joys are as a priest. I tell them
that my greatest joy is being able to gather with all of you Sunday after
Sunday to celebrate the Eucharist in our magnificent Cathedral. There are
many other joys of priestly ministry, but this one surpasses them all. How
grateful I am to be a part of this wonderful community of faith. Happy
Feast Day!</p>
