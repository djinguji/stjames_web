<p><b>CATHEDRAL SOUND SYSTEM</b>. We have done a
significant amount of work in recent months to improve
the quality of the sound system in the Cathedral, and
many parishioners have commented on the
improvement. However, the Cathedral is a very large,
reverberant space, which presents great challenges for a
sound system. We are aware that there are still some
places in the Cathedral where it can be difficult to
hear. If you have trouble hearing the readings and
homily, we recommend that you try sitting in a different
location. You might also consider using one of our
listening devices, available from the ushers.</p>
<p><b>YOUTH MIGRANT PROJECT THANK YOU</b>. Thank you to St. James Cathedral 
Parish for your support of the Youth Migrant Project mission trip. With your 
help we collected over $1,100 and a couple carloads of donations. It was 
wonderful to be able to share these with the migrant families we met in the 
Skagit Valley. Your prayers strengthened us and helped us have a great week as 
well. To see pictures and read reflections on our trip, check out the recent 
additions to <a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/outreach/ympblog.htm">our

<p><b>WELCOME, PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN</b>. We
support all of our parishioners who are attending Mass
with young children and we welcome those children
into our midst. If you find that your child needs a quiet
place away from the stimulation of the Mass, please
feel free to step into the west vestibule or the cathedral
chapel, where we have provided a sound system so
that you can continue to participate in the Mass. We
appreciate your effort to be with us and to include
your child in our worship.</p>
<p><i>Please note that babysitting is available in the Mother
Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach Center during
the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</i></p>
<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never
officially registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to
register</i>. Registered parishioners receive important
mailings from the Cathedral (including offering
envelopes!), are regular recipients of the Cathedral’s
quarterly journal <i>In Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate
their wedding at the Cathedral, and their children may
attend any of the five Catholic Rainbow Schools at
parishioner rates (and become eligible for Cathedral
scholarship money). In addition, if you are a registered
parishioner and use envelopes, or are on the direct
debit program, we will mail you a quarterly report of
your contributions to the parish. Registration cards can
be found in the vestibule. Please drop the completed
card in the collection basket or put it in the mail. If
you’re not sure whether you’re registered at St.
James, call the parish office at 206-622-3559.</p>

offerings are a venerable custom in the Church, and a
wonderful way to remember a deceased loved one,
celebrate an anniversary, or give thanks for an answered
prayer. <i>Information</i>

6:30 pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight,

in France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect
way to end a busy week.</p>

<p>We are the cathedral for the
Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle
and its Archbishop, The Most
Reverend Alexander J. Brunett.
We are also a parish church for a
vibrant faith community with a
long history that reaches back to
Seattle’s early days.</p>
<p>We are an inner-city parish with an
outreach to many who live on the edge of
poverty and loneliness. We are a diverse
community that welcomes, accepts, and
celebrates the differences we all bring. We
exist in the heart of the city, yet sometimes
our parishioners come from considerable
distances to worship here.</p>
<p>St. James Cathedral is a crossroads where
ideas and challenges both old and new are
explored in the light of the Gospel of Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>Our cathedral is also the center for many
cultural and ecumenical events which both
reflect and help to shape the fabric of a vital
metropolitan community.</p>

<p>Above all, St. James Cathedral is a
community of prayer.</p>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Philomena
in Des Moines, St. Lawrence in Raymond, and Mary, Queen
of Peace in Sammamish.</p>
