<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James is
proud to welcome visitors from near and far
throughout the summer months. Each week a
drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from
among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your
address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and
drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your
presence in our midst today. <b>Last week, we had visitors
from Laguna Hills, CA; New Malden, Surrey, UK;
Collegeville, MN, and many other places! The winner
of our drawing was from Wildwood, MO.</b> </i> </p>

		<p>After sixteen years of constant use, the kneelers on our
Cathedral chairs are worn out. We need 600 new
kneelers… and we need your help! Each new kneeler
will cost $40. So far, 41 parishioners have funded
138 kneelers. Only 462 to go! Will you
sponsor a kneeler... or two? Your knees
will thank you! You can try out the new
kneelers at Coffee Hours today. You’ll feel
the difference! Information, Maria
Laughlin, 206-382-4284.

<p><b>ANNUAL CATHOLIC APPEAL <i>SHORTFALL</i>!</b> We have met
the goal the Archbishop set for us, but we are still
$40,000 short of our parish goal. <i>This will seriously and

yet made a pledge or gift to the Appeal, and are in a
position to do so, please consider making a gift today by
visiting the
<a class="navy" target="_bulletin" href="http://www.seattlearch.org/aca">Annual 
Catholic Appeal website</a>. A gift of $365 ($1 per
day!) will make a huge difference. Your support is crucial
to allow St. James to meet its financial obligations.

<p><b>TOURS OF THE CATHEDRAL</b>. During the summer
months, June through August, we offer tours of the
Cathedral every Wednesday at 1:00pm. Gather in the
west vestibule; no reservations required. This is a great
opportunity to show your Cathedral to out of town
guests!</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL SOUND SYSTEM</b>. We have done a
significant amount of work in recent months to improve
the quality of the sound system in the Cathedral, and
many parishioners have commented on the
improvement. However, the Cathedral is a very large,
reverberant space, which presents great challenges for a
sound system. We are aware that there are still some
places in the Cathedral where it can be difficult to
hear. If you have trouble hearing the readings and
homily, we recommend that you try sitting in a different
location. You might also consider using one of our
listening devices, available from the ushers.</p>
<p><b>FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS AT THE ALTAR</b>. Floral
offerings are a venerable custom in the Church, and a
wonderful way to remember a deceased loved one,
celebrate an anniversary, or give thanks for an answered
prayer. <i>Information</i>
