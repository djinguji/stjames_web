<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>One week from now we will bring the Easter season to a close by
celebrating the great feast of Pentecost. If you were at Mass last weekend,
you are aware that we are now in the middle of a novena in preparation for
Pentecost. And how important this traditional novena is this year! Our need
as a Church for conversion and renewal — for a full and rich outpouring of
the gifts of the Holy Spirit — has never been greater. And then there is our
particular need as an Archdiocese to pray for the guidance of Church leaders
as they engage in the process of choosing a new archbishop for this local
Church. Exactly when this will happen is unknown to us but it is certainly in
the works. How appropriate, then, that we join in earnest prayer at this time
for a new archbishop who will model for us the servant ministry of Jesus and
lead us with love and courage in the ways of the gospel! If you didn’t
receive a Pentecost Novena prayer card last weekend, please pick up one
today at the place of prayer in the north aisle and join in this important
parish prayer.</p>
<p>I want to thank each one of you who has made a pledge or a gift to
the Annual Catholic Appeal. Thanks to your incredible generosity, we have
now met the $300,000 goal set for us by the Archdiocese! From this point on,
everything given to the Appeal will come back to the parish as a rebate. Our
hope is to raise $175,000 in rebate monies this year. This will help us
significantly in meeting our parish’s $275,000 obligation toward the five
central district Catholic (“Rainbow”) schools. If you have not yet had the
opportunity to make your gift to the Annual Appeal, I encourage you to do
so at this time. There are pledge forms in the pews and you should have one
at home, as well. If possible, please consider making a pledge to be paid off
over a period of as many as 10 months. Thank you. <i>Your timely response will
save the money required for expensive follow-up letters</i>.</p>
<p>May this glorious feast of the Ascension deepen our commitment
to preaching and living the gospel, and may the coming feast of Pentecost set
us on fire with wisdom, courage, and love!</p>
