<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b> is up and running!
Your friendly Cathedral baristas will be serving espresso
drinks after the 10:00 Mass. During the month of October,
all proceeds will benefit the Children’s Religious
Education Program. If you are interested in becoming a
Cathedral barista, please call Sean and Katherine Berry at
206-571-6868. Training is provided!</p>
<p><b>PRAYER, MARY AND THE SAINTS: FOUNDATIONS IN
FAITH SERIES TODAY</b>. Sunday, October 17, 1:30-5:30pm,
St. Peter’s Parish Hall in Beacon Hill. Participants will
learn the four types of prayer and learn the difference
between public and private prayer and why both are
important in the life of a Catholic. In addition,
participants will explore what we learn about Mary
through each of the Gospels and look at various images
of Mary that have emerged through the centuries. We will
explore the historical development of sainthood. This is a wonderful
opportunity for an in-depth look at Catholic teaching
and its implications for our everyday lives. Cost: $5 per
class. (Cosponsored by St. James Cathedral with the
South Seattle Deanery) <i>Information</i>,
