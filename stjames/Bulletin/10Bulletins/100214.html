world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.

<p><b>MARCH BOOK GROUP SELECTION: <i>WHAT IS THE WHAT</i></b>. Join us on Tuesday, March 23 for a discussion
of <i>What is the What</i> by Dave Eggers. Valentino Achak
Deng, real-life hero of this engrossing epic, was a
refugee from the Sudanese civil war. Separated from
his family when Arab militia destroy his village,
Valentino joins thousands of other "Lost Boys" on their
march to squalid refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya.
He eventually reaches America, but finds his quest for
safety, community and fulfillment in many ways even
more difficult. Eggers gives Valentino an unaffected,
compelling voice and makes his narrative by turns
harrowing, funny, bleak and lyrical. Available in the
Cathedral Bookstore. <i>Information</i>,

<p>February 14, 2010</p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>As we prepare to embark on our Lenten
journey, I can’t help but be aware of something
happening this Lent of 2010 that is quite unique.
Thanks to your generosity, the archdiocese has
purchased a series of television commercials called
“Catholics Come Home” which will be appearing
on various TV channels throughout the Lenten
season. The messages are mainly directed toward
Catholics who, for whatever reason, have not been
active in the practice of their faith, and they carry an
invitation to them to consider coming back home.</p>
<p>I see this as a fine opportunity for all of us to
do what we already do very well: to reach out in a
warm and welcoming way whenever we see a face
we haven’t seen before. And “Catholics Come
Home” also provides us with the perfect entrée for
personally inviting a friend, neighbor, or family
member who has been away from the Church to join
us for Mass.</p>
<p>And I want to observe that “coming home” is
not just for others! There is really not one of us who
does not, in one way or another, need to “come
home.” That’s true even if we’ve been coming here
regularly for a long time. I say this because “coming
home” is not a moment or even a decision: it’s a
journey – a personal journey, and a journey made in
the company of others. At its deepest and its best,
it’s a journey deeper and deeper into the heart of
God. And who of us doesn’t need to make that
journey?!</p>
<p>So, dear friends, we will all do well to think of
this great season of Lent as our “coming home”
time. And the Church offers us some wonderful,
time-tried ways of doing this. Let me mention the
most important ones.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER</b>. Spending time with God. Giving
God time to speak to us, and entering into a 
heart-to-heart conversation with God. The most
important prayer we have is, of course, the Sunday
Mass we celebrate together. If we were to do
nothing more this Lent than to bring a greater
awareness and a greater fervor to each of these
Sunday celebrations, we would be accomplishing a
great deal. The Sundays of Lent are definitely the
right place to start. But we needn’t stop there.
Lenten weekday Masses are also a fine way to
“come home,” to come closer to Christ -- as many of
you know so well. And here are a few other
possibilities: taking some time each day to read and
reflect prayerfully on a gospel passage; attending
Vespers and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament
on Sunday afternoons; joining the Friday evening
Taizé ecumenical Prayer around the Cross; praying
the Stations of the Cross on Mondays, Wednesdays,
or Fridays; or joining in a Lenten Holy Hour on a
Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Still one other great opportunity for prayer
and for helping a person to “come home” would be
to “adopt” one of our 14 “Elect” (the people who
will be baptized at the Easter Vigil). Adopting
means taking it on yourself to pray for that person
in a special way all during Lent. Prayer cards will
be available in the cathedral and in the parish hall
during the first few weeks of Lent, each one with the
name of one of our Elect. If you take a card, (and I
really hope you do), in addition to your prayer, you
will be invited when it gets close to Easter to write a
card or a short note telling your “adopted” friend of
your prayerful support. It strikes me that this is
something EVERYONE can do!</p>
<p><b>FASTING</b>. This, too, can be a personal
“coming home,” a coming home to ourselves –
perhaps coming to terms with our excesses and with
all the ways we pamper ourselves. Fasting can also
help us come closer to Jesus who willingly accepted
suffering and even death in order to show us the
depth of his love for us. What better way to draw
close to Jesus than by freely doing what he did:
denying ourselves some of life’s comforts? And
what better way to draw close to the suffering
people of the world—the hungry, the homeless, the
hopeless—than by tasting, even in a small way, their
cup of suffering?</p>
<p><b>ALMSGIVING</b>. I like to connect this with
fasting. Fasting is best, I think, when it takes us out
of ourselves and awakens us to the sufferings of
others. For millions upon millions in our world
there is no “coming home” because they have no
home. Literally! And they have no food or clothing
or medicine or any of the other necessities of life.
Again this year I commend to you Catholic Relief
Services’ Rice Bowl Program as a great vehicle for
turning fasting into a work of Christian love. Think
what will happen this Lent if you make the Rice
Bowl your channel for Lenten almsgiving – putting
aside the money you save by eating a little more
simply. At the beautiful Mass of Holy Thursday
when we invite the parishioners to bring forward
their Rice Bowls at the collection time of the Mass,
you will see in a powerful way how people who
take Lent seriously can make a difference not only
in their lives but in the lives of hungry people in our
world.</p>
<p>Dear friends, by all means let us warmly
welcome all those who have accepted the invitation
to “come home” to their Church, but let us also use
the opportunity of these holy 40 days to make our
own journey home in ways that will bring us closer
to God and to one other!</p>
