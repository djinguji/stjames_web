<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>. Floral offerings are a
wonderful way to remember a deceased loved one,

has been answered. This week’s arrangements are from
Gwen Johnson and Carolyn Schmidt to commemorate the
fourth anniversary of their father, Ainar Johnson’s entry
into Heaven. If you have been inspired to give thanks
with flowers, please contact

<p><b>ATTENTION YOUNG ADULTS…</b> We have had a
number of recent inquiries regarding events,
activities and Bible studies for young adults in our
parish. What we are in need of is a small team of
young adults to determine the “what” and “when”
and also to facilitate the events or activities along
with staff assistance. Being team can be as much fun
as the events! <i>Information</i>
