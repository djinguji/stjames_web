from 1:30-5:30 PM. Participants will explore the
seven sacraments and their symbols, ritual actions, and
effects. They will understand sacramentals and their
use. The class will look at all aspects of Eucharist
Liturgy: its relationship to the Paschal Mystery; the
Liturgical Year and the Lectionary cycle; its structure;
why it is the “source and summit” in the life of the
Christian. If possible, please bring your Bible and
copy of the Catechism to the class. Cost: $5 per
class. (Co-sponsored by St. James Cathedral with the
South Seattle Deanery) <i>Information</i>,

<p align="center"><font face="Papyrus" size="5">JOURNEY OF THE ELECT</font></p>
<p>Lent is a particularly special time for the Elect who
have been journeying towards baptism, Eucharist
and confirmation at the Easter Vigil. As part of
their preparation, the Church celebrates anointing
with the oil of the Catechumen, blessings and
exorcisms. Beginning next weekend, we will join
in prayer for our Elect as they participate in the
ancient ceremonies called the Scrutinies that
symbolize the spiritual purification taking place in
their lives as they prepare for baptism. Through
these Scrutinies, blessings and anointings, the Elect
are encouraged to reflect more deeply on their own
spiritual challenges and weaknesses. At the same
time, these rites offer powerful prayers of faith,
hope and strength on their behalf, calling upon
God’s grace and mercy to penetrate their entire
lives. Please continue to keep them in your
prayers.</p>
<p><b>LENTEN PRAYER PARTNERS FOR THE ELECT</b>. It is
not too late to “adopt” one of our Elect as they
prepare to celebrate the sacraments of Baptism,
Confirmation and Eucharist. You are asked to pray
everyday for him/her asking for God’s blessings
and guidance. Also, notes and cards will be
collected during Holy Week to be given to the Elect
before Easter. Prayer cards are available at the
place of prayer located in the north aisle of the west
nave of the Cathedral (where you can also learn
more about each of them in our Book of the Elect),
in the bookstore, and in Cathedral Hall during
Sunday morning hospitality. You can also <a href="../../Events/2010/elect2010.htm">meet our Elect</a>. Your prayers make a
difference!!! <i>Information</i>
