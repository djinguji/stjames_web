<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

<p><b>WINTER SHELTER VOLUNTEER TRAINING</b>. Results
from the 2010 One Night Count showed over 2,750
people living on the streets of King County. With
difficult economic times in our nation; we are likely
to see even more people facing homelessness. As
part of our response to the need in our community,
St. James will again be hosting a Winter Shelter from
October to April. We are gearing up for our 19th year
of operation and will be holding a training for all
new and returning volunteers on Sunday, September
19 at 7pm in Cathedral Hall. We are in need of
overnight hosts, someone to organize our toiletries
donations, and volunteers to make breakfast in the
mornings. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ATTENTION YOUNG ADULTS…</b> We have had a
number of recent inquiries regarding events,
activities and Bible studies for young adults in our
parish. What we are in need of is a small team of
young adults to determine the “what” and “when”
and also to facilitate the events or activities along
with staff assistance. Being team can be as much fun
as the events! <i>Information</i>
