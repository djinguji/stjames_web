<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.

<p><b>YOUNG ADULTS “WARM HEARTS AND SOLES”</b>. 6th annual Advent sock drive for 
homeless men continues today, Sunday, December 13 and each Sunday in Advent. 
Your generosity so far is warming our hearts, but we still have a way to go to 
reach our goal of 2010 pairs for delivery in January 2010 to warm the soles of 
those in need. Let’s keep it up by dropping off new socks at the Young Adult 
table in Cathedral Hall after 8:00am, 10:00am, and 12:00 Sunday Masses, or 
during the week at 2nd floor Cathedral Place. Such a worthwhile project – let’s 
keep those hearts and soles warm this winter! <i>Information</i>
