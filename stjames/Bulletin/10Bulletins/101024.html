<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>WORLD MISSION SUNDAY</b>. Today we take up a special
collection to support missionary efforts in more than
1,100 of the poorest dioceses around the world—Asia,
Africa, remote regions of Latin America, the Pacific
Islands—as well as the Catholic Home Missions in the
United States and its territories. On behalf of the missions
around the world, thank you for your generosity.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b> are from the Saturday
wedding of Erin Herlihy and Thomas Fritz. <i>Floral offerings are a wonderful 
way to remember a deceased loved one, celebrate an anniversary, or give thanks 
for a prayer that has been answered. If you have been inspired to give thanks 
with flowers, please contact </i>

<p><b>CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. We have a great selection of

bags, postcards, and much, much more! The Cathedral
Bookstore is staffed entirely by volunteers, and is open
weekdays 11am-3pm, and after each of our weekend
Masses. Stop by today!</p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b> is up and running!
Your friendly Cathedral baristas will be serving espresso
drinks after the 10:00 Mass. During the month of October,
all proceeds will benefit the Children’s Religious
Education Program. If you are interested in becoming a
Cathedral barista, please call Sean and Katherine Berry at
206-571-6868. Training is provided!</p>
<p><b>CATHOLIC SOCIAL TEACHING—FOUNDATIONS IN FAITH
TODAY</b>, October 24, St. Peter’s Parish Hall, 1:30-5:30pm. Participants will 
learn the basic principles and identify the sources of Catholic Social Teaching. 
We will explore what is meant by “a consistent ethic of life” and how it is the 
basic theological principle which undergirds the Church’s social teachings. We 
will also discuss the role of a Catholic’s well-formed conscience in impacting 
the political world. Cost: $5 per class. (Cosponsored by St. James Cathedral 
with the South Seattle Deanery) <i>Information</i>,

	<p><b>HELP A NEIGHBOR IN NEED</b>. Many people in our
community require help with transportation,
shopping, laundry, housework, and more.
Advanced age, chronic illness and financial
difficulties can prevent our neighbors from
accomplishing these routine daily tasks. By
volunteering just a few hours a month with
Volunteer Chore Services, you can help someone
stay in his or her own home, avoiding the need to
move to a nursing home or other institutional
setting. Training for this rewarding ministry is
scheduled for Wednesday, November 17 at 6:00 pm
in the Fireside Room of the Pastoral Outreach
Center (907 Columbia). <i>Information</i>,
