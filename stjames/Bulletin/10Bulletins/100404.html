<p>Easter Sunday, 2010</p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>It is a joy to be able to welcome you to St. James Cathedral on this Easter of
2010. I do so in the name of our Archbishop, Alexander J. Brunett, as well as in my
own.</p>
<p>Of all the times we gather as Christian believers, none is more important than
this one. Easter is the greatest of all our feasts. It celebrates the Mystery that is the
very foundation of our Christian faith, for, as St. Paul wrote, “<i>If Christ has not risen,
our faith is in vain</i>.” (1 Cor. 15: 14)</p>
<p>But Christ <i>has</i> risen and your presence here in the Cathedral both affirms and
celebrates that most startling and enduring of all realities. While we do not see him,
we know he lives and that he is in our midst breathing life and hope into us, walking
alongside us on our pilgrimage of faith, our journey toward the Kingdom.</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing what is in your heart as you come here on this
Easter Sunday. For some, I am sure, there is joy and a keen sense of hope for the
future as Spring with all its promise bursts forth all around us; for others there may
be the burden of pain that comes from losing a job or from serious illness, or the grief
that comes from the death of a loved one. For others, this may be the Easter that you
decided to reclaim the practice of your Catholic faith — or at least to explore that
possibility. No matter why you came or what you bring with you this Easter day,
I hope you know that you are welcome at St. James Cathedral, and I hope that you
find something here that will comfort you, challenge you, and give you hope. We live
in a world that, while incredibly beautiful, is also seriously flawed. Death and life are
never very far away from us. But Easter boldly proclaims that death is not the whole
story. Easter proclaims for all to hear that death does not have the last word. Life
does!</p>
<p>My prayer today is that you will be renewed in faith and hope as you join in
worship here at St. James Cathedral.</p>
<p>If you are a visitor, please know that you are warmly welcomed here. I hope
you will find something today that will touch your heart, awaken your spirit, and
make you want to return to this holy place again and again. If you are part of the
regular family of St. James, I take this opportunity to thank you for all the ways you
make the Risen Lord Jesus present in this parish and in this city: through your
prayer, your faith, and your love that overflows in such generous and unselfish
service, especially to the poor.</p>
<p>May the blessings of the Risen Lord Jesus be yours in abundance.</p>
