<p><i>December 20, 2009</i></p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I’m writing to extend a special invitation.</p>
<p>I know that at this busy time of year you are probably overloaded with obligations
and things you feel you must do. But this is something you can put under the heading of
<i>long-term planning</i> since it’s more than a year away. However, since it’s going to require
some serious thinking—and a decision by May!—I thought it best to bring it to you at this
early date.</p>
<p><b>Plans are currently underway for a parish pilgrimage to Rome a little over a year
from now—February 17-26, 2011, to be exact, and I’d like to invite you to consider
joining me and the Cathedral Choir of St. James on this trip</b>. It won’t be any ordinary
kind of pilgrimage, I assure you! In addition to being a prayerful experience, it should also
be a lot of fun. The tour company that manages arrangements has access to important
churches, shrines, and places of interest that few others do. Highlights include celebrating
Sunday Mass at the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls—one of the greatest of all
Christian basilicas. We’ll also have the opportunity to celebrate three Masses in St. Peter’s,
including the evening Mass on the Feast of the Chair of St. Peter (a pretty unique
opportunity) and a Mass at the tomb of Blessed John XXIII (my hero). There will be ample
time for visiting important tourist sites of Rome and a general audience with Pope Benedict
XVI. The Cathedral Choir will also present a formal concert at the great Jesuit church of
S. Ignazio. Following our days in Rome, we will have a couple of days to visit Naples and
its environs, including Pompeii, Capri, Sorrento and the fabulous Amalfi coast.</p>
<p>This will be the third time I will have been privileged to lead a Cathedral parish
pilgrimage to Rome and, unless God has some startling surprises in store, I’m pretty sure it
will be my last!</p>
<p>I hope you will consider joining us. If you’ve never been to Italy, this is a 
wonderful way to experience it for the first time. But even if you’ve been many 
times, this is a unique experience of community, history, and music you won’t 
want to miss. In the coming weeks you’ll see more information in our parish 
bulletin. And you can learn more about the trip, including pricing and itinerary 
details, at our <a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/pilgrimage">parish 
website</a>.</p>
<p>Please do consider yourself invited!</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to

world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.

<p><b>YOUNG ADULTS “WARM HEARTS AND SOLES”</b>. 6th annual Advent sock drive for

dropping off new socks at the Young Adult table in Cathedral Hall after 8:00am, 
10:00am, and 12:00 Sunday Masses, or during the week at 2nd floor Cathedral
