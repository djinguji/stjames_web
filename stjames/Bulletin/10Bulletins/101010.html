<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central

<p><b>PRAYER, MARY AND THE SAINTS: FOUNDATIONS IN
FAITH SERIES</b>. Next Sunday, October 17, 1:30-5:30pm,
St. Peter’s Parish Hall in Beacon Hill. Participants will
learn the four types of prayer and learn the difference
between public and private prayer and why both are
important in the life of a Catholic. We will look at the
Psalms and the Lord’s Prayer in particular. In addition,
participants will explore what we learn about Mary
through each of the Gospels and look at various images
of Mary that have emerged through the centuries;
summarize the doctrines of the Immaculate Conception
and the Assumption; and look at cultural images of
Mary. We will explain the Church’s response to
apparitions and other private revelations, and learn the
origins, uses and meanings of the Rosary. We will
explore the historical development of sainthood; the
process of Canonization; and the importance of being
given a Saint’s name at Baptism. This is a wonderful
opportunity for an in-depth look at Catholic teaching
and its implications for our everyday lives. Cost: $5 per
class. (Cosponsored by St. James Cathedral with the
South Seattle Deanery) <i>Information</i>,
