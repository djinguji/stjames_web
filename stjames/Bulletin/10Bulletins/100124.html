<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.

		Dear Friends,<p>Your response to the collection last
weekend for earthquake relief in Haiti was
nothing short of magnificent. Over $30,000
was donated in that spontaneous collection
following the Masses! You hardly need me to
tell you – but I’ll do it anyway – that this is an
absolutely typical and true-to-form response
from this parish. And it will make a real
difference in the lives of the Haitian people
who are suffering so mightily.</p>
<p>If you were not able to be here last
Sunday and would like to contribute to this
effort, you may do so by using one of the
special red envelopes in the pews and chairs.
If you write a check, please make it payable
to Catholic Relief Services, or if you make it
payable to the Cathedral, write “Haiti relief”
on the memo line. Thank you.</p>
