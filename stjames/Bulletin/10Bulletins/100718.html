<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James is
proud to welcome visitors from near and far
throughout the summer months. Each week a
drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from
among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your
address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and
drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your
presence in our midst today. <b>Last week, we had visitors
from Lyon, France; Niceville, FL; Surrey, BC, and
many other places! The winner of our drawing was
from Mayville, WI.</b> </i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>. According to a pious
legend, lavender received its sweet scent when Mary
washed the Christ Child's clothes and hung them to dry
on a lavender bush. When the sun and wind had dried the
clothes, they smelled sweet and clean. <i>If you have been
inspired to give thanks with flowers, please contact

<p><b>NEW IN THE BOOKSTORE</b>. Beautiful statues of St. Francis
for your garden or backyard—in stock for a limited time

summertime, and a variety of books related to our patron,
James, and the <i>camino</i> to his shrine at Santiago de
Compostela.</p>
<p><b>CHORAL MUSIC NEXT SUNDAY</b>. At both the 10:00 and

involvement of the parish community. A new inquiry
