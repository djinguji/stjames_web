<p align="center"><font face="Papyrus" size="5">JOURNEY OF THE ELECT</font></p>
<p>This week we celebrate the third and final Scrutiny
with the Gospel story of the raising of Lazarus.
Death is our greatest fear and this story reminds us
that God’s power and mercy are greater than ANY
fear, sin or pain that we have in our lives. The
Elect are asked to think about what needs to die in
their lives in order for them to receive the new life
being offered to them in baptism. For some, the
question of whether they even want to come out of
the tomb is important, whether they are willing to
risk coming out into the light of Christ to see what
awaits them. This week they will also be presented
with The Lord’s Prayer, which teaches us that God
loves as a loving father and will “give us …our
daily bread” and “lead us from temptation.” As
they approach these last days of preparation before
baptism, keep them in your prayers.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER CARDS FOR THE ELECT</b>. Thank you for
keeping our Elect in your prayers during this season
of Lent. Now is the time to turn in your
personalized cards or notes for our Elect that will be
distributed to them on Holy Saturday. You can
drop off your cards in the baskets located at the
place of prayer in the Cathedral, in the Hall during
hospitality on Sunday mornings, or in the
Bookstore during its regular hours. They need to be
turned in no later than Holy Thursday evening.

call to repentance is matched by the
overwhelming compassion and
forgiveness of God. The story of the
woman caught in adultery shows us that
Jesus does not want to condemn us, but rather to place
us on the path to new life. Our prayer, fasting, learning,
and giving with Catholic Relief Services’ Operation Rice
Bowl opens paths to new life for our brothers and
sisters in need. </p>
<p>This week, Rice Bowl focuses on
Ethiopia, where droughts and famines often prevent
farmers from harvesting adequate food to provide for
their families. To help address this issue, CRS aids in
the operation of agriculture and water projects. These
services assist farmers in efficient management of
natural resources, allowing them access to water and
control of their crops. For more information on Ethiopia,
