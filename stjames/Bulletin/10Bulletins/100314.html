<p align="center"><font face="Papyrus" size="5">JOURNEY OF THE ELECT</font></p>
<p>This week we celebrate the second of the three
Scrutinies with the retelling of the story of the man
born blind. This Gospel challenges our Elect to
reflect more deeply upon their lives, with particular
focus on the “blind spots” that prevent them from
even seeing the effects of sin and evil in their lives
and in the lives of others. Later this week, the Elect
will be presented with our Creed. The Church
“lovingly entrust to them…this ancient text that has
always been regarded as expressing the heart of the
Church’s faith and prayer.” The Creed is presented
in order to enlighten the Elect and it recalls the
wonderful deeds of God for the salvation of the
human race. The Elect are to commit the Creed to
memory and will recite it publicly on Holy
Saturday. Continue to enter into these solemn rites
in prayer with our Elect as they prepare for
baptism, Eucharist and confirmation, and to pray
for them every day, for your prayers do make a
difference!</p>

time to change our ways, to turn
back to God our Father, and to

<p align="center"><b>GOOD NEWS
FROM THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN</b></p>
<p>We regularly receive monetary gifts from a variety of
people and places, but this month we received a very
special gift to be cherished!</p>
<p>The Cathedral Kitchen was given a cardboard cereal
box that had been modified to accommodate
donations to the Kitchen. What makes the gift so
special is that it contained $222.03, and came from a
six-year-old boy who had asked for donations for the
kitchen instead of presents on his birthday! Not only
that, his 9-year-old sister made cookies and cupcakes
to collect $430 for the earthquake victims in Haiti.
Both the recipients and the gift-givers are winners
here. And that’s good news! </p>
<p>Thank you, Giancarlo
and Maria, for your unselfish gifts!</p>

<p><b>WELCOME, PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN</b>. We
