<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>. Did you know…? The
association of the lily with the Blessed Virgin Mary dates

involvement of the parish community. A new inquiry
session will begin Wednesday, July 14 at 7:00 pm.

<p><b>CHARITY IN TRUTH</b>. On July 17, Jim Thomas from the
Archdiocese of Seattle will present a workshop at St.
Bridget’s in Seattle on Pope Benedict’s first social
encyclical, entitled <i>Caritas in Veritate</i> (Charity in Truth). The United 
States Conference of Catholic Bishops site says the encyclical “is a call to see 
the relationship between human and environmental ecologies and to link charity 
and truth in the pursuit of justice, the common good, and authentic human 
development. In doing so, the pope points out the responsibilities and 
limitations of government and the private market, challenges traditional 
ideologies of right and left, and calls all men and women to think and act 
anew.” The workshop will present an overview of the encyclical and discuss how 
it can be used to address the current economic crisis. Registration forms are 
due by July 6 and can be accessed
