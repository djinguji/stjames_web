<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.

involvement of the parish community. A new inquiry
session will begin Wednesday, January 13.

<p><b>SANTO NIÑO – HOLY CHILD</b>. On Sunday, January 17, at
the Noon Mass, we will have our annual celebration of
the Santo Niño, the Holy Child Jesus. The image of
Jesus as vulnerable child and mighty King is beloved
throughout the world, and in a special way in the
Philippines. All are invited to bring their own images
of the Child Jesus from home for the blessing. The
annual celebration will be followed by a fiesta in
Cathedral Place Hall, with dancing, a raffle, and, of
course, a marvelous feast of Filipino food prepared by
a group of our own parishioners. All are welcome.</p>

<p><b>FUNERAL PLANNING</b>. Many people have questions
regarding funerals—questions ranging from the
Church’s position regarding cremation and burial to
how and when funerals are scheduled and celebrated in
the Cathedral. Since the time of the death of a loved
one is likely to be very emotionally draining, it is
clearly not the best time for dealing with such
questions. In an effort to help parishioners be prepared
ahead of time, the Cathedral offers a simple guide, available at our 
<a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/funerals">parish website</a>. 
This information is also in a booklet that may also be
obtained by calling the parish office.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially
registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to register</i>.
Registered parishioners receive important mailings
from the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are
regular recipients of the Cathedral’s highly acclaimed
journal <i>In Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate their
wedding at the Cathedral, and their children may attend
any of the five Catholic Rainbow Schools at
parishioner rates (and become eligible for Cathedral
scholarships). In addition, if you are a registered
parishioner and use envelopes, or are on the direct
deposit program, we will mail you a quarterly report of
your contributions to the parish. Registration cards can
be found in the vestibule. <i>If you're not sure whether
you're registered at St. James, call the parish office at
206-622-3559</i>.</p>
