<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Two weeks ago I shared with you that you spontaneously contributed
some $30,000 on the Sunday following the devastating earthquake in
Haiti. Today, I’m happy to be able to tell you that the amount has now
risen to $44,000! What a testimonial that is to your amazing generosity
and care for those in need. I’ve checked and there’s not another parish in
the archdiocese that has even come close to this. In fact, the next highest
amount raised in a parish was $17,000. And I should add that our
monthly St. Vincent de Paul collection was only a little shy of its usual
total. That, too, says a lot about you!</p>
<p><i>Great Music for Great Cathedrals</i> is on the Cathedral’s menu this week.
If you have never seen this production (or even if you’ve seen it often),
I hope you’ll decide to take it in this year because rumor has it that this
will be its last run. This Thursday is “parish night” at Great Music. All
you need to do is come. If you’d like to make a donation, fine, but none is
expected. Only you are expected…!</p>
<p>Lent, of course, is just around the corner. Next Sunday’s bulletin will
have extensive material about this holy season and the many liturgies,
prayers, educational and service opportunities that the parish will be
offering. Stay tuned</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you

world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.

<p><b>MARCH BOOK GROUP SELECTION: <i>WHAT IS THE WHAT</i></b>. Join us on Tuesday, March 23 for a discussion
of <i>What is the What</i> by Dave Eggers. Valentino Achak
Deng, real-life hero of this engrossing epic, was a
refugee from the Sudanese civil war. Separated from
his family when Arab militia destroy his village,
Valentino joins thousands of other "Lost Boys" on their
march to squalid refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya.
He eventually reaches America, but finds his quest for
safety, community and fulfillment in many ways even
more difficult. Eggers gives Valentino an unaffected,
compelling voice and makes his narrative by turns
harrowing, funny, bleak and lyrical. Available in the
Cathedral Bookstore. <i>Information</i>,
