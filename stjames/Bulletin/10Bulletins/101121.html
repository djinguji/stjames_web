<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b> are in memory of
Lorraine Johnson from her grateful family.</p>
<p><b>WELCOME, ARCHBISHOP SARTAIN</b>. Since the
appointment of Archbishop J. Peter Sartain as our new
archbishop, we have had a special place of prayer for him
in the Cathedral, near the Cathedra (bishop’s chair). We
have added a book in which you can write directly to him,
letting him know of your prayer and support. We plan to present him with this book when
he arrives at the beginning of December. Please stop by
to offer a prayer and write a message to Archbishop Sartain.</p>
<p><b>MASS OF THANKSGIVING DAY</b>. On Thanksgiving Day,
Thursday, November 25, there will be one Mass only in
the Cathedral, at 9:30am. This is a wonderful time to
gather as a parish family to give thanks to God for all the
blessings we have received. All are invited to bring along
non-perishable food items for the poor, which will be
brought to the altar at offertory time. Please note that the
parish office will be closed Friday and Saturday,
November 25 and 26.</p>
<p><b>YOUNG ADULTS (21 - 30-SOMETHING) 3RD SUNDAY</b>.
Scripture sharing and informal social time is TODAY,
Sunday, November 21 starting at 4:00pm. Do you ever
wonder how the Sunday readings relate to our everyday
lives? Enjoy fellowship, wine, and cheese from 4:00 to 4:30 followed by sharing 
how the Scripture readings for the day speak to you in your everyday life. The 
study will finish in time to attend 5:30 Mass. Young adults over the age of 21, single or
married, gather in the Fireside Room of the Pastoral
Outreach Center. All are welcome! <i>Information</i>
