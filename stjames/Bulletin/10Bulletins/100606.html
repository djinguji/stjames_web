<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know how welcome
you are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from Matilda and Jose Banez in thanksgiving on their 55th wedding anniversary.
Flowers are also from the Saturday wedding of Ciara
Hugie and Conor Cook.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER FOR THE EARTH WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. On
Friday, June 11 at 6:30 pm in the Cathedral, you are
invited to join in an ecumenical prayer in response to the
disastrous oil spill in the Gulf. With readings, song, and
silence, we will pray for those working on the scene, and
for a greater respect for all of creation.</p>
<p><b>SEE THE REAL FACE OF IMMIGRATION</b>. Join us on Tuesday, June 8 at 7:00 
pm in Cathedral Place, second floor, for a showing of <i>Under the Same Moon</i> 
followed by discussion on immigration through the lens of Catholic Social 
Teaching, which tells us that human life is sacred and the dignity of the human 
person is the foundation of a moral vision for society, and that we are one 
human family whatever our national, racial, ethnic, economic, and ideological 
differences. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>THE NEXT SENIOR TRIP</b> will be Wednesday, June 16.
First we will visit the Botanical Gardens in Bellevue: a

woodlands. Our second stop will be lunch at Rudy’s
Diner in Woodinville. Our final destination will be the
lovely Chateau Ste Michelle where we will enjoy a
private winery tour and taste. Please join us! Space is
limited and priority will be given to registered
parishioners. <i>Information, or to reserve your place</i>,

a service trip to a hospital in Haiti at the end of

<p><b>WELCOME, PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN</b>. We
support all of our parishioners who are attending Mass
with young children and we welcome those children
into our midst. If you find that your child needs a quiet
place away from the stimulation of the Mass, please
feel free to step into the west vestibule or the cathedral
chapel, where we have provided a sound system so that
you can continue to participate in the Mass. We
appreciate your effort to be with us and to include your
child in our worship. <i>Please note that babysitting is
available in the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral
Outreach Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon
Masses</i>.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially
registered. We strongly encourage you to register.
Registered parishioners receive important mailings
from the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are
regular recipients of the Cathedral’s journal <i>In Your
Midst</i>, are able to celebrate their wedding at the
Cathedral, and their children may attend any of the five
Catholic Rainbow Schools at parishioner rates (and
become eligible for Cathedral scholarship money).
Registration cards can be found at the Welcome Table
at coffee hours. Please drop the completed card in the
collection basket or put it in the mail. If you’re not sure
whether you’re registered at St. James, call the parish
office at 206-622-3559.</p>
