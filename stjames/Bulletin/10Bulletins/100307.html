visitor or a newcomer, we want you to know how
welcome you are at St. James Cathedral. You’re
invited to visit a welcome table at the coffee hours in
Cathedral Hall. You’ll have a chance to ask questions and
find out more about St. James Cathedral. If you’re a Catholic
who’s been away from the Church,
there’s an opportunity to talk to a
member of our “Welcome Back” team
in an informal setting at the “Come
Home Café” in Cathedral Hall.

<p><b>LENTEN HOLY HOUR</b>. Each Friday during Lent, we will
have a Holy Hour with Exposition of the Blessed
Sacrament at 12 Noon. Holy Hour includes the Liturgy
of the Hours, meditations, rosary, and Benediction of
the Blessed Sacrament.</p>
<p><b>CONFESSION TIMES</b>. In addition to our regular
confessions on Saturday afternoons (4-5pm), this Lent
we are offering two additional opportunities to celebrate
this important sacrament: Tuesdays, 7:45-8:10am, and
5:00-5:25pm. Please also mark your calendar for the
Day of Reconciliation, Saturday, March 20, when
confessions will be heard from 10:00am to 5:00pm.</p>

Liturgy: its relationship to the Paschal Mystery; the
Liturgical Year and the Lectionary cycle; its structure;
why it is the “source and summit” in the life of the
Christian. If possible, please bring your Bible and

hear the call of Moses to lead his people
from oppression to freedom. God
promises to be with them as they
journey to a new life. Our participation in
Rice Bowl unites us in prayer, fasting,
and giving with the millions of people throughout the
world who are oppressed by poverty, injustice, war,
disease, and lack of education and other opportunities.</p>
<p>This week, Rice Bowl focuses on Afghanistan, where safety concerns, distance, 
and resources can all be barriers to quality education. To help address these 
issues, CRS aids in the operation of community-based schools for boys, girls, 
and young women. Villagers work together to support the schools, teachers, 
students, and one another through these community programs. For more information

<p align="center"><font face="Papyrus" size="5">JOURNEY OF THE ELECT</font></p>
<p>This weekend we celebrate the first of the three
Scrutinies with the retelling of the story of the
Samaritan woman at the well. This Gospel
challenges our Elect to be honest about their
personal lives just as the woman was with her
encounter with Christ. In acknowledging their
sinfulness and need for healing, they come to
know more fully the mercy and loving acceptance
of Christ in their lives. To prepare for their
Scrutiny, each is asked to reflect upon what he/she
most thirst for in life, and then to bring that to this
ancient rite for God’s grace. Continue to enter into
these solemn rites in prayer with our Elect as they
prepare for baptism.</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>A lot has happened in the month since my last letter. For one thing, we had three
amazing nights of Great Music for Great Cathedrals. Even more amazing is that 367
parishioners pitched in to make it happen! To each of them, my congratulations and
sincere thanks for bringing an incredible experience of beauty to our city and to our parish.
Great Music we will not see again, but beautiful music we shall surely hear and beautiful
things we shall most definitely see. So stay tuned!</p>
<p>Record numbers of people filled the Cathedral for the Masses of Ash Wednesday.
The good weather no doubt helped, but I think there was more: a realization that Lent is
the perfect time for soul-searching and for reflecting on Christ’s suffering, death, and
resurrection and how they can come alive for each of us and give meaning to everything
we do. May our Lenten journey bring us closer to Christ and to each other.</p>
<p>Fourteen of our parishioners participated in the Rite of Election on the day
following Ash Wednesday. They are no longer catechumens now, but “Elect.” They have
been chosen for Baptism and the sacraments of Confirmation and Eucharist, and these
days of Lent will be especially important for them as they prepare for those powerfully
transforming sacramental celebrations at the Easter Vigil. Please pray for them, and, if
possible, please consider becoming a “Prayer Partner” with one or another of them during
the remainder of Lent. You can do this by visiting the special place of prayer in the
Cathedral’s north aisle or you can even do it by going online to the Cathedral’s website.
We make it easy!</p>
<p>Catholics Come Home, the television advertising campaign that is currently being
run throughout Western Washington, is, I’m sure, getting some people to think about their
faith and their relationship to the Church. I hope you’ll keep these people in your prayers
and, should you meet one at Mass or at the coffee hour, extend a word of welcome. You
might also enjoy visiting the Cathedral’s website and viewing a very engaging brief video
of some of our parishioners who tell of their return to the Church at St. James. It’s a quick
‘watch’ and a worthwhile one.</p>
<p>I usually try to get away for a retreat during Lent and this year is no exception. I’m
making a return visit to Downside Abbey in the west of England to spend some days with
the Benedictine monks there. Please keep me in your prayers!</p>
