<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.

<p><b>YOUNG LIVES ON HOLD: THE COLLEGE DREAMS OF
UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS</b>. Each year, 65,000
undocumented immigrant youth legally graduate from
the U.S. public school system. They graduate into a
world where all steps towards furthering their future are
blocked. Ineligible for legal employment and financial
aid to put toward a higher education, they live under the
threat of deportation to a foreign country they’ve never
known. Dr. Roberto Gonzales, a University of
Washington professor, offers a resolution in his report
on this unique population, including the bipartisan
DREAM Act and its benefit to the U.S. economy. Read

<p><b>FUNERAL PLANNING</b>. Many people have questions
regarding funerals—questions ranging from the
Church’s position regarding cremation and burial to
how and when funerals are scheduled and celebrated in
the Cathedral. Since the time of the death of a loved
one is likely to be very emotionally draining, it is
clearly not the best time for dealing with such
questions. In an effort to help parishioners be prepared
ahead of time, the Cathedral offers a simple guide,
available at our parish <a href="http://www.stjamescathedral.org/funerals/">website</a>. 
This information is also in a booklet that may also be
obtained by calling the parish office.</p>
