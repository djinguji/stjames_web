    ELECT</font></p>
    <p>This week we celebrate the second of the three Scrutinies with the retelling of the
    story of the man born blind. This Gospel challenges our Elect to reflect more deeply upon
    their lives, with particular focus on the &#147;blind spots&#148; that prevent them from
    even seeing the effects of sin and evil in their lives and in the lives of others. Later
    this week, the Elect will be presented with our Creed. The Church &#147;lovingly entrust
    to them&#133;this ancient text that has always been regarded as expressing the heart of
    the Church&#146;s faith and prayer.&#148; The Creed is presented in order to enlighten the
    Elect and it recalls the wonderful deeds of God for the salvation of the human race. The
    Elect are to commit the Creed to memory and will recite it publicly on Holy Saturday.
    Continue to enter into these solemn rites in prayer with our Elect as they prepare for
    baptism, Eucharist and confirmation, and to pray for them every day, for your prayers do
    make a difference! </td>

<p><strong>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH?</strong> You are
invited to participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the Catholic community of
faith. It is a process which encompasses the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching, and
Christian values&#151;the development and deepening of a life of prayer and
action&#151;all with the support and involvement of the parish community. A new inquiry
session will begin April 9 on Wednesday evenings. <i>Information</i>, <a

listening system? If you have difficulty hearing the spoken word, please talk to an usher

<p><strong>THE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM</strong> is a program which encourages us all to be
good stewards of our health by participating in physical exercise. Our goal is to log
enough miles to reach Jerusalem by Easter. (Right now we&#146;re treading water off the
coast of Lisbon!) While many do this by walking, we are finding that some parishioners are
swimming, biking, treadmilling, elliptical training and weight-training too. More
importantly, though, during the journey we are encouraged to reflect on our own call to
discipleship and see how best we might join with the disciples of Jesus as they walked
with him as &#147;followers of the way.&#148; If you have miles to log or would like more
information, we&#146;d like to hear from you! <i>Information</i>, <a

<p><strong>COMPACT DISCS FOR THE HOMEBOUND</strong>. The audio ministry to the homebound
is currently making the change from cassette tapes to CD&#146;s. This change may be an
economic hardship for some. Thus, if you would like to donate a new CD player or one you
are no longer using we would welcome your help! At present we need ten CD players. <i>Information</i>,

Paul invites you to join them in their ministry to the poor and suffering on First Hill,
Capitol Hill and Downtown. Based on Christ&#146;s model of compassion, members conduct

    Denis and François are neighbors in Coteaux, Haiti. For years they barely supported their
    families through subsistence farming. In 2002, they joined an agricultural cooperative
    organized by Catholic Relief Services and began to see change. They received and planted
    better seed, diversified their crops, found better techniques for raising livestock,
    learned to combat erosion, and generated surplus crops to take to market. Now their
    families no longer face hunger or malnutrition. As Jesus transformed the life of the blind
    man, so CRS transforms the lives of rural farmers. By giving through Operation Rice Bowl
    and purchasing Fair Trade products, we support the dignity of workers by ensuring just
    wages and economic self-sufficiency. </td>
