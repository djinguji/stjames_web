<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year because we are the Cathedral Church,
we remember in prayer at Mass and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This week we remember in
prayer the parishes of Sts. Peter and Paul, Tacoma and Aberdeen; St. Thomas, Tukwila; and
the Mission Church of St. Thomas, Clallam Bay. </p>

<hr>

<p><i>June 29, 2008 </i></p>

<p>Dear Friends, </p>

<p>It&#146;s a nice coincidence that the feast of Saints Peter and Paul falls on a Sunday
this year. I say that because the Church begins today a special year dedicated to St.
Paul. Why this year? Well, 2008 marks the two-thousandth anniversary (give or take &#150;
we don&#146;t have actual dates to go by) of his birth. Why a year dedicated to St. Paul?
Because a case can be made for calling him the second most influential figure in the
entire history of Christianity. Second only to Jesus. During the coming year, our parish
will continue to offer educational opportunities to learn more about St. Paul and his
writings. You can read more on a special page in today&#146;s bulletin, or the more
technologically savvy among you can check the special feature on the <a
href="../../liturgy/stpaul/stpaulhome.htm">Cathedral&#146;s website</a>. </p>

<p>Last Sunday night we were privileged to host Jean Vanier, the founder of the
L&#146;Arche movement and, without doubt, one of the living saints of our time. His
profound yet simple message awakened all of us to the mysterious way God is present in the
little people of our world &#151; the poor, the vulnerable, the ones we call disabled
&#150; and of how they nourish us spiritually and call us to what is truly important in
life. The joy and peace and love that are so visible in Vanier&#146;s face &#150; even
before he ever speaks a word &#150; must be something like the joy and peace and love that
people once saw in the face of Jesus. People often remark to me that they feel a Presence
&#151; hard to define but hard to miss &#151; whenever they come into St. James Cathedral.
If you feel that Presence today, perhaps it&#146;s because of the quiet grace Jean Vanier
and the wonderful family of L&#146;Arche brought to us last Sunday evening. How blessed we
were! </p>

<p>You will be happy to know that we will be hosting the SHARE Safe Haven overnight
shelter for the months of July and August. Until recently this shelter has been housed in
the former INS building. When the GSA terminated their arrangement SHARE asked if we would
be willing to give them the use of the Cathedral Hall for the remainder of the summer.
I&#146;m sure you will agree that it&#146;s a privilege to be able to share our facilities
with 30 homeless people. </p>

<p>Summer seemed slow to arrive this year but better late than never. I hope these days
are good for you and that they bring some opportunities for relaxation and leisure. May
they also be days of deepening our relationship with God. Have a blessed summer! </p>
