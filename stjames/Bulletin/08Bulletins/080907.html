    <p><i>Each week during the coming Year of St. Paul, watch this space in the bulletin for
    reflection questions that will lead us deeper into the writings and example of St. Paul.

      <li>&#147;Love is the fulfillment of the law,&#148; St. Paul says boldly in today&#146;s
        second reading (Romans 13:8-10). What do you think St. Paul means when he talks about
        love? What kind of love fulfills the law? </li>
      <li>In his homily for the opening of the Pauline Year, Pope Benedict XVI emphasized that
        Paul&#146;s faith in Jesus Christ was not an idea but an encounter: &#147;Paul's faith is
        being struck by the love of Jesus Christ, a love that overwhelms him to his depths and
        transforms him. His faith is not a theory, an opinion about God and the world. His faith
        is the impact of God's love in his heart. Thus, this same faith was love for Jesus
        Christ.&#148; In your own journey of faith, can you think of times when you met Jesus in
        this way? </li>
