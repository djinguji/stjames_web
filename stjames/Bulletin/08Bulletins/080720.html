    <p><b>GLEANING</b> is the traditional Biblical practice of gathering crops that would

    morning to four local grocery stores and collect the leftover (produce, dairy, deli, etc.)
    that the stores have been unable to sell. We use these giveaways as key ingredients in our
    evening meals that we serve daily to 150 needy people. If you would like to be a part of
    this gleaning tradition, please call Jim or Jill McAuliffe, 206-264-2091. <i><b>We are
    also looking for new volunteers who may be interested in being a part of our daily cooking
    and prep teams</b></i>. </td>

    <p><i>Each week during the coming Year of St. Paul, watch this space in the bulletin for
    reflection questions that will lead us deeper into the writings and example of St. Paul.
    You are also invited to visit the Place of Prayer in the west aisle and on the <a

      <li>In today&#146;s second reading, St. Paul says to the Romans, &#147;we do not know how to
        pray as we ought&#148; (Romans 8: 26). Do you feel that you &#147;know how to pray&#148;?
        Do you pray with words, or without? Is prayer difficult for you at times? Have you ever
        felt what Paul describes&#151;the Spirit coming to the aid of your weakness? </li>
      <li>At every Mass, we pray the General Intercessions, also called the Prayer of the
        Faithful, in which we bring before God the specific needs of our church, world, and local
        community, here and now. St. Paul tells us that the Spirit &#147;searches hearts,&#148;
        our hearts, and understands what we need and what is God&#146;s will for us. What specific
        intentions do you bring with you today? </li>
