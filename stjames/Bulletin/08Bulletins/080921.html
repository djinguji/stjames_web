      <li>This week, we turn from Romans to Philippians in our weekly readings from St. Paul. The
        struggle between the flesh and the spirit is a constant in St. Paul&#146;s writings, and
        we hear that struggle again in this passage. Paul longs to &#147;depart this life and be
        with Christ&#148; (Philippians 1:23), yet he knows that he can help this young Christian
        community if he remains. When have you found yourself caught between two good things? How
        do you resolve that tension? </li>
      <li>Paul is writing to the Philippians from prison. In the midst of his suffering, he can
        say, &#147;Christ will be magnified in my body.&#148; He would say it another way in the
        letter to the Colossians: &#147;in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in the
        afflictions of Christ&#148; (1:24). Paul firmly believes that suffering has a purpose.
        What is your attitude towards suffering? Do you have a sense that the big sufferings in
        your life have had a purpose? </li>
