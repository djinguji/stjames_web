<p><b>WELCOME SUMMER VISITORS!</b> St. James is proud to welcome visitors from near and
far throughout the summer months. Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be
made from among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your address on the visitor
envelope provided in the pew and drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your presence in our midst today. </p>

<p><b>FLOWERS</b> in the Cathedral are from the Saturday wedding of Connie Le and Larry
Gallwas. </p>

<p><b>SUMMER CHOIR</b>. Make a joyful noise with other parishioners young and old at the
12:00 Noon Sunday Mass. This is a great way to meet others, to support our community and
to participate in a very active way in the Cathedral&#146;s liturgies. Rehearsals in
Cathedral Place, up the stairs on Terry Avenue, Sundays 11:15 am. <i>Information</i>, <a

<p><b>SOUND SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS</b>. You may have noticed some changes in the sound system
in the last couple of weeks. We are in the process of a major retuning and re-equalizing
of the sound system in the Cathedral. As may of you know, it is an amazing complex system
for the very complex and challenging acoustics of this wonderful building. As this work
involves a bit of &#147;trial and error&#148; with the building full and under actual Mass
conditions, please bear with us if there are some glitches along the way. We are confident
that the end result will be worth the inconvenience required to get our system to operate
at its full potential. </p>

<p><i><b>IN YOUR MIDST</b></i>. Our parish journal is being mailed this week to all
registered parishioners. This issue focuses on the &#147;Journey of Faith,&#148; with
meditations by Cathedral parishioners. Other features include a recap of Jean
Vanier&#146;s June visit, the recent &#147;Youth Migrant Project&#148; in Lynden, and an
album of our Parish Picnic and celebration of St. James. You can also read the new issue <a

    <p><i>Each week during the coming Year of St. Paul, watch this space in the bulletin for
    reflection questions that will lead us deeper into the writings and example of St. Paul.
    You are also invited to visit the Place of Prayer in the west aisle and on the <a
    target="_stpaul" href="../../liturgy/stpaul/stpaulhome.htm">website</a>.</i> <ul>
      <li>In today&#146;s second reading St. Paul says, &#147;the gifts and the call of God are
        irrevocable&#148; (Romans 11: 29). What do you feel are your gifts? What is your calling?
        Has your understanding of your gifts and your vocation changed over time? </li>
      <li>Scripture scholar Nicholas King of South Africa writes of this passage: &#147;God gives
        his gift out of love for us, not out of admiration for our achievements. It follows that
        any complacent smirking on our part is a huge misunderstanding, not to say perversion, of
        God&#146;s offer of salvation. We are all on the same footing. Do you find yourself
        thinking &#145;I&#146;m better than those others&#146;? Do you think that Paul would allow
        that?&#148; </li>
