<p><strong>FROM THE DESK OF THE PASTOR</strong> </p>

<p>November 9, 2008 </p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>

<p>The month of November gives us a wonderful opportunity to come close in prayer and in
gratitude to the faithful departed&#151;all those who have gone before us in the peace of
Christ. We have long had the custom of remembering on the front cover of all the November
bulletins all those generous parishioners who have remembered the Cathedral by leaving a
bequest. Those listed have all died during the twenty years I have been privileged to
serve here. Reading over their names is a wistful thing for me&#151;but a good
thing&#151;as I see their faces, recall their personalities, and remember their goodness.
By including the Cathedral in their will, these people&#151;some of them of very modest
means, others quite wealthy&#151;have continued to make a difference in the lives of many
people long after they have gone home to God. Please join me in praying for them and in
thanking God for them, as well as for all our parishioners who have gone home to God.</p>

<p>This is our annual Sacrificial Giving Sunday. It happens to fall this year on the day
the Church celebrates the dedication of the great basilica of St. John Lateran, the
Pope&#146;s Cathedral, the Cathedral church of Rome. Ironically, the gospel is the story
of Jesus&#146; cleansing of the temple by turning over the tables of the money changers.
How&#146;s that for bad timing! However, I know you realize that any similarity between
our talking about money today and what Jesus did to the money changers is pretty
superficial. They had compromised the holiness of the temple; we, on the other hand,
actually contribute to the holiness of this place by the sacrifices we make. Let me take
this opportunity to thank you in advance for your generous response to this annual
invitation to support the parish. I realize that the current economic crisis is a very
real worry for many. All I ask is that you respond in a way that is in keeping with
God&#146;s goodness to you. If you do, we will be able to meet our obligations and
continue our outreach to the poor and needy.</p>

      <li>On this Feast of the Dedication of St. John Lateran, we read a passage from St.
        Paul&#146;s first letter to the Corinthians (I Cor. 3: 9c-11, 16-17). In his writings, St.
        Paul often uses vivid and memorable images to describe various aspects of the life of
        faith. In this passage, he says, &#147;You are God&#146;s building&#148; (3:9). How is
        this metaphor different from some of the others Paul uses (a field, for example, or the
        human body)? What does it reveal about the Church? Do you have a sense of being the
        Church? </li>
      <li>St. Paul applies the image of the building not only to the community of believers, but
        to each individual: &#147;you are the temple of God.&#148; How does the knowledge that the
        Holy Spirit dwells in you affect what you do, and how you treat others? Our Sacrificial
        Giving theme this year echoes St. Paul: &#147;You are St. James Cathedral.&#148; When have
        you had a sense of being part of this community of faith? Of being the face of Christ for
        others? </li>
