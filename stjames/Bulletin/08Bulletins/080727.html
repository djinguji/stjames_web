<p><b>WELCOME SUMMER VISITORS!</b> St. James is proud to welcome visitors from near and
far throughout the summer months. Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be
made from among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your address on the visitor
envelope provided in the pew and drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your presence in our midst today. <i>Last
week, we had visitors from Oklahoma City, OK, Alea, HI, and Amagasaki, Japan, to name a
few! The winner of our drawing was from Newnan, GA</i>. </p>

<p><b>LAST CHANCE TO VIEW THE SACRED STEPS EXHIBIT</b>. The artwork that has graced our
chapel is continuing its pilgrimage to another site. This weekend is your last opportunity
to walk the way of Santiago right here in Seattle. Photographs, paintings and drawings
lead us along the Pilgrim way of our patron, St. James. </p>

<p><b>CHILDREN&#146;S LITURGY OF THE WORD</b>. This wonderful event in the chapel at noon
Mass makes the Liturgy of the Word more meaningful to the children at their age
appropriate level. We thank our presenters and cantors this past year who helped the
children understand and appreciate better God&#146;s word and sing God&#146;s praises.
There will be a short summer break and during the month of August when we will not have
the Children&#146;s Liturgy of the Word. It will resume on September 7, the same Sunday
when Children&#146;s Faith Formation registration will take place. </p>

<p><b>CONGRATULATIONS AND GOD&#146;S BLESSINGS</b> to parishioners Ashley Nelson and
Christopher Rossman; and Audrey Ordonia and Michael Ghali married in the Cathedral on
Saturday, July 19. Please keep them in your prayers as they begin their new life together.

    <p><i>Each week during the coming Year of St. Paul, watch this space in the bulletin for
    reflection questions that will lead us deeper into the writings and example of St. Paul.
    You are also invited to visit the Place of Prayer in the west aisle and on the <a
    target="_stpaul" href="../../liturgy/stpaul/stpaulhome.htm">website</a>.</i> <ul>
      <li>On this Feast of St. James, we hear a reading from St. Paul&#146;s second letter to the
        Christian community at Corinth (2 Corinthians 4: 7-15). This reading perfectly captures
        the experience of our patron, James, who was the first of the Twelve to suffer martyrdom:
        &#147;We who live are constantly being given up to death for the sake of Jesus.&#148; In
        our country, we enjoy freedom of religion. But there are ways in which believers are
        &#147;afflicted,&#148; &#147;perplexed,&#148; &#147;persecuted,&#148; and &#147;struck
        down,&#148; to use St. Paul&#146;s words, in our culture. Have you ever suffered for your
        faith in Christ? </li>
      <li>As St. Paul says, &quot;we have the same spirit of truth&quot; as did James and the
        Apostles, the Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead. Who are your favorite saints? How
        have they influenced you? How have they brought you closer to Christ? </li>
