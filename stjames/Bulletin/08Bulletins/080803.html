<p><b>WELCOME SUMMER VISITORS!</b> St. James is proud to welcome visitors from near and
far throughout the summer months. Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be
made from among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your address on the visitor
envelope provided in the pew and drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your presence in our midst today. <i>Last
week, we had visitors from Kingston, Jamaica, Livonia, MI, and Armagh, N. Ireland, to name
a few! The winner of our drawing was from Pocahontas, KS. </i></p>

<p><b>FLOWERS</b> in the Cathedral are from the Saturday wedding of Christiane Wilson and
Val Cummings. </p>

<p><b>CHILDREN&#146;S LITURGY OF THE WORD</b>. This wonderful event in the chapel at noon
Mass makes the Liturgy of the Word more meaningful to the children at their age

children understand and appreciate better God&#146;s word and sing God&#146;s praises.
There will be a short summer break and during the month of August we will not have the
Children&#146;s Liturgy of the Word. It will resume on September 7, the same Sunday when
Children&#146;s Faith Formation registration will take place. </p>

<p><b>THIS WEEK IN THE BOOKSTORE</b>. Great summer reading that will stay with you through
the year; books for informing yourself on Faithful Citizenship; and St. Francis garden art
for your flowerbeds or window boxes. </p>

Nathan Standifer, married in the Cathedral on Saturday, July 26. Please keep them in your
prayers as they begin their new life together. </p>

        persecution, hunger, and war; and other powers as well: death and life, time itself. And

find that your child needs a quiet place away from the stimulation of the Mass, please
feel free to step into the west vestibule or the cathedral chapel, where we have provided
a sound system so that you can continue to participate in the Mass. We appreciate your

Cathedral, and their children may attend any of the five Catholic Rainbow Schools at
parishioner rates (and become eligible for Cathedral scholarships). In addition, if you
are a registered parishioner and use envelopes, or are on the direct debit program, we
will mail you a quarterly report of your contributions to the parish. Registration cards
can be found in the vestibule. Please drop the completed card in the collection basket or

<p><strong>FROM THE DESK OF THE PASTOR</strong> </p>

<p>August 3, 2008 </p>

<p>Dear Friends, </p>

<p>Our celebration of the feast of St. James last weekend was wonderful in every way
(except, perhaps, for the weather!). A number of visitors told me that they had
couldn&#146;t remember a more beautiful celebration of Mass. And to top it all off, we had
a great picnic! Many thanks to everyone who made the celebration possible: liturgical
ministers as well as picnic planners and a host of volunteers. Special thanks to Anna
Horton and Stephen Pace who, once again this year, organized the entire event and worked
their special magic both behind the scenes and on the scene. </p>

<p>Let me take this opportunity to thank you for your amazing response to this year&#146;s
Annual Catholic Appeal. Thanks to your incredible generosity, we not only met the goal set
for us by the Archdiocese ($255,000), but also raised an additional $180,000 for the
parish. There are no adjectives that can adequately describe this achievement, and there
are no words that can adequately describe the gratitude I feel. &#147;Thank you&#148; will
have to do. Needless to say, there is no other parish in the Archdiocese that came even
remotely close to what you did. </p>

<p>I&#146;m doing double duty today (Sunday). After preaching at the 10:00 Mass I will be
making a mad dash over to St. Mark&#146;s Episcopal Cathedral where I&#146;ve been invited
to preach at the 11:00 Eucharist. It was an honor to be asked and I look forward to it. My
stay over there will have to be brief, however, since we have a large &#145;crop&#146; of
babies &#150; 13, I&#146;m told, to be baptized at our noon Mass! </p>

<p>The summer was late in arriving and is quick in passing. It&#146;s hard to believe that
we&#146;re on the downward slope of it already. I hope the remaining weeks give you a
chance for some R &amp; R before the busy fall months arrive. </p>
