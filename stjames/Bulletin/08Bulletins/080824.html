<p><b>WELCOME SUMMER VISITORS!</b> St. James is proud to welcome visitors from near and
far throughout the summer months. Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be
made from among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your address on the visitor
envelope provided in the pew and drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your presence in our midst today. </p>

<p><b>FLOWERS</b> in the Cathedral are from the Saturday wedding of Mark Thompson and
Binta Watkins. </p>

<p><b>LAST SUMMER CHOIR SUNDAY</b>. Make a joyful noise with other parishioners young and
old at the 12:00 Noon Sunday Mass. This is a great way to meet others, to support our
community and to participate in a very active way in the Cathedral&#146;s liturgies.
Rehearsal in Cathedral Place, up the stairs on Terry Avenue, Sunday 11:15 am. </p>

<p><b>CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. It&#146;s not too late to find a good book on our shelves
to end the summer with. And, look for the display of books on topics relating to Faithful
Citizenship and current events. </p>

<p><b>ILLUMINATING THE WORD: THE SAINT JOHN&#146;S BIBLE</b>. Tickets are still available

<p><b>SOUND SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS</b>. You may have noticed some changes in the sound system
in the last couple of weeks. We are in the process of a major retuning and re-equalizing
of the sound system in the Cathedral. As may of you know, it is an amazing complex system
for the very complex and challenging acoustics of this wonderful building. As this work
involves a bit of &#147;trial and error&#148; with the building full and under actual Mass
conditions, please bear with us if there are some glitches along the way. We are confident
that the end result will be worth the inconvenience required to get our system to operate
at its full potential. </p>

<p><b>REST IN PEACE</b>. Please pray for the repose of the souls of Ida Bullinger and Mary
Beth Kelly. </p>

    <p><i>Each week during the coming Year of St. Paul, watch this space in the bulletin for
    reflection questions that will lead us deeper into the writings and example of St. Paul.

      <li>Today&#146;s wonderful second reading comes near the end of St. Paul&#146;s long
        discourse on the chosen people, the Israelites. Argument gives way to praise as Paul
        exclaims in wonder at the wisdom and mystery of God. Have you experienced that same sense
        of awe at times, in your journey of faith? </li>
      <li>St. Paul speaks of God as essentially unknowable. But in our Gospel reading today, Peter
        recognizes Jesus as the Christ&#151;the Son of God. Can you think of a time when, whether
        in a flash of insight, or slowly over time, you came to a deeper knowledge of who God is? </li>
