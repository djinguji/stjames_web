<p><b>KEEP ST. MARTIN DE PORRES SHELTER AND LAZARUS DAY CENTER OPEN</b>. Two of the
Archdiocesan Housing Authority&#146;s programs, the Lazarus Day Center and St.
Martin&#146;s Shelter, are in danger of having to close their doors two days a week due to
budget short falls. They are asking the City of Seattle for $85,000 to help keep their
doors open. Without this funding, hundreds of elderly homeless people will be at risk.
