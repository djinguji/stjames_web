<p><b>WELCOME:</b> If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know how welcome
you are &#150; whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city. </p>

<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are in memory of Jim &#147;Barney&#148; Barnes on the first
anniversary of his death, from his family. <i>If you are interested in offering flowers as
a memorial remembrance, to celebrate a special occasion, or in thanksgiving, please call <a
href="mailto:kkaiser@stjames-cathedral.org?subject=Flowers for the Cathedral">Kay Kaiser</a>,

<p><b>CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. Take Cathedral music home with you by choosing from a wide
selection of CDs from our own St. James Cathedral musicians. We have two of Sr. Helen
Prejean&#146;s books in stock, as well as the new Marilynne Robinson book <i>Home</i>, a
companion to a Cathedral favorite, <i>Gilead</i>. And don&#146;t forget to get ready for a
visit to Seattle by Kathleen Norris. We have a good supply of her books. </p>

<p><b>VOLUNTEER CHORE SERVICE ORIENTATION</b>. VCS helps connect volunteers with people
who need chore services and companionship. Volunteers help to ensure that elders and
individuals with disabilities and/or long-term illnesses can remain in their homes rather
than going to an institutionalized setting. If you are interested in joining them in this
rewarding ministry, please come to the Orientation to be held in the Pastoral Outreach
Center on Monday, October 6 at 6:30 pm. <i>Information</i>, <a

<p><b>SOUND SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS</b>. We are in the process of a major re-tuning and
re-equalizing of the sound system in the Cathedral. As this work involves a bit of
&#147;trial and error&#148; with the building full and under actual Mass conditions,
please bear with us if there are some glitches along the way. We are confident that the
end result will be worth the inconvenience required to get our system to operate at its
full potential. </p>

<p><b>SANDWICHES FOR ST. MARTIN&#146;S</b> may be brought to the Coffee Hours next Sunday,
October 12, or to the parish office on Monday October 13 before 3:00 pm. </p>

singers. A brief and simple audition is required to test pitch matching skills. Students
participate in Cathedral Parish and Archepiscopal liturgies and concerts throughout the

    <p><i>Each week during the coming Year of St. Paul, watch this space in the bulletin for
    reflection questions that will lead us deeper into the writings and example of St. Paul.
    You are also invited to visit the Place of Prayer in the west aisle and on the <a

      <li>We are so surrounded by turmoil these days &#150; political, economic, social &#150;
        that the first words of today&#146;s second reading might sound naive. &#147;Have no
        anxiety at all,&#148; Paul says (Philippians 4:6). Paul does not want the Philippians to
        ignore or become indifferent to the tensions and trials of life. Instead, he urges them to
        focus all their energies on prayer: &#147;in everything&#133; make your requests known to
        God.&#148; What are the sources of anxiety in your life? And what is the &#147;true&#133;
        honorable&#133; just&#133; pure&#133; lovely&#133; gracious&#148; in you, and in the world
        around you? </li>
      <li>Paul summarizes his message to the Philippians in these bold words: &#147;Keep on doing
        what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me&#148; (4:9). Paul lives so
        entirely in Christ that his words and actions serve as a model for others &#150; a living
        Gospel. What changes can we make in our manner of speaking and acting to be more
        transparent witnesses to Christ? </li>
