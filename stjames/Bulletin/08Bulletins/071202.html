<p><strong>WELCOME!</strong> If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know
how welcome you are&#151;whether you have come from another part of the country, from
across the world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part,
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city. </p>

<p><b>LISTENING DEVICES</b>. Did you know the Cathedral has an assistive listening system?
If you have difficulty hearing the spoken word, please talk to an usher about borrowing a
listening device to use during Mass. </p>

featuring our young people&#146;s choir, the Schola Cantorum, directed by Stacey Sunde. We

devotional books for Advent. </p>
