    ELECT</font></p>
    <p>This weekend we celebrate the first of the three Scrutinies with the retelling of the
    story of the Samaritan woman at the well. This Gospel challenges our Elect to be honest
    about their personal lives just as the woman was with her encounter with Christ. In
    acknowledging their sinfulness, they come to know more fully the mercy and loving
    acceptance of Christ in their lives. To prepare for their Scrutiny, each is asked to
    reflect upon what he/she most thirst for in life, and then to bring that to this ancient
    rite for prayer, grace and healing. Continue to enter into these solemn rites in prayer
    with our Elect as they prepare for baptism. </p>
    <p><b>LENTEN PRAYER PARTNERS FOR THE ELECT</b>. It is not too late to &#147;adopt&#148;
    one of our Elect as they prepare to celebrate the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation and
    Eucharist. You are asked to pray everyday for him/her asking for God&#146;s blessings and
    guidance. Also, notes and cards will be collected during Holy Week to be given to the
    Elect before Easter. Prayer cards are available at the place of prayer located in the
    north aisle of the west nave of the Cathedral (where you can also learn more about each of
    them in our Book of the Elect), in the bookstore, and in Cathedral Hall during Sunday
    morning hospitality. You can also meet our Elect by going to our <a
