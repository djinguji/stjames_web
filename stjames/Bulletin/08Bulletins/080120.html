    April, St. James operates an overflow shelter for 10-14 men from Catholic Community
    Services&#146; St. Martin de Porres Shelter. The men are 50 and over and cannot stay at
    St. Martin&#146;s because of lack of space in the cold winter months. Pairs of volunteers
    serve as overnight and/or breakfast hosts once a month. We always welcome more breakfast
    cooks but are especially in need of volunteers who can serve as overnight hosts on a
    Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Monday night. <i>Information</i>, <a

    up for the Orientation to be held in the Pastoral Outreach Center at 6:30 pm on Tuesday,
