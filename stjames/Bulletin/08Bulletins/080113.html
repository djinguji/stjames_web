<p><strong>FROM THE DESK OF THE PASTOR</strong> </p>

<p>January 13, 2008 </p>

<p>Dear Friends, </p>

<p>Do you have the feeling we have been in church a lot lately? It&#146;s more than a
feeling. It&#146;s a fact! There were the Advent Masses, the Advent Reconciliation
Service, several Advent musical events, Christmas, New Year&#146;s, Epiphany, and today,
the Feast of the Baptism. It&#146;s been a journey toward the Light through the
year&#146;s darkest days, a blessed journey to be sure. </p>

<p>To all of you who worked so hard to make those days the beautiful ones they were, a
heartfelt word of thanks. Your work did not go unnoticed. As one person put it to me after
the 10:00 Mass on Christmas morning, &#147;St. James really knows how to do
Christmas!&#148; </p>

<p>But we did more than pray during those days. True to form, hundreds of you accepted the
challenge to reach out to the people in the Southwest part of our state who suffered so
greatly during the early December floods. In response to the invitation one Sunday, and
without any prior notice, you spontaneously dropped more than $8,000 into the collection
baskets as you left the Cathedral. The following Sunday you gave another $8,000-plus to
the St. Vincent de Paul Society which they generously turned over to the flood victims. In
his letter of thanks to the parish, our parishioner, Andre de Klaver, Executive Director
of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, wrote, &#147;St. James Cathedral is the place where
people in Seattle go for help and comfort in times of tragedy. The flood victims around
Western Washington will now also benefit from your compassionate outreach. May God bless
you for your generosity.&#148; </p>

<p>What can I add to that? May God indeed bless you for your generosity. And may this
Feast of the Baptism of Christ we celebrate remind us of why we do all we do around here! </p>

<p>Father Michael G. Ryan<br>
<em>Cathedral Pastor</em></p>

<p><strong>WELCOME!</strong> If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know
how welcome you are&#151;whether you have come from another part of the country, from
across the world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part,
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city. </p>
