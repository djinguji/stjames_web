<p><b>WELCOME!</b> If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know how welcome
you are &#151; whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy in a
fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to needy
people living in the central district of our city. </p>
