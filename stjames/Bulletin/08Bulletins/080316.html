<p><strong>WELCOME!</strong> If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know
how welcome you are&#151;whether you have come from another part of the country, from
across the world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part,
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city. </p>

<p><b>HOSPITALITY ON PALM SUNDAY</b>. Because the Mass will be longer than usual, there
will be <i><b>no</b></i> coffee hour following the 10:00 Mass today. Our regular coffee
hour will resume the Sunday <u>after</u> Easter. </p>

<p><b>EASTER FLOWERS</b>. If you would like to help beautify the cathedral for Easter
Masses, please use the specially marked pew envelopes, or the one in your envelope packet,
and place your contribution in the collection basket along with your regular Sunday
contribution. </p>

<p><b>BLOOD DRIVE THANK YOU</b>. 43 people came to the Pastoral Outreach Center on Tuesday
March 11 to donate blood at the third annual St. James Cathedral Blood Drive. The Health
and Healing Ministry would like to thank all of you who made the effort to be there and
participate, and gratefully acknowledge your Lenten donation of the gift of life. The
Puget Sound Blood Center was very pleased with the turnout. The Blood Drive is becoming a
new tradition for St. James Cathedral. </p>

<p><b>GOVERNOR SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER AT ST. JAMES</b>. In a signing ceremony at the
Pastoral Outreach Center Governor Chris Gregoire established the New Americans Policy
Council supporting immigrant integration into Washington state communities. What do we
know about the economic and social results of integrating immigrants and their children in
our state? Migration Policy Institute (MPI) offers fact sheets and articles on the most
current immigration and integration data. To view the document she signed or to access
MPI&#146;s new interactive data hub visit <a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/esl">the

    <p>Our Elect are now entering their final week of preparation for the Easter Vigil, where

    in the faith. They will participate with us in our Holy Week liturgies, being dismissed
    for the last time on Holy Thursday evening. They will also participate in a daylong
    retreat on Holy Saturday in their final preparation rites prior to the celebration of the
    Vigil of all vigils! You are encouraged to join us at the Easter Vigil to celebrate this
    most important day of their lives where we, the baptized, will also renew our baptismal
    promises as we celebrate the resurrection of our Lord. </p>

    during this season of Lent. Now is the time to turn in your personalized cards or notes

    cards in the baskets located at the place of prayer in the Cathedral, in the Hall during
    hospitality on Sunday mornings, or in the Bookstore during its regular hours. <b><i>The

thousands of dollars in donations. Now there is another opportunity to continue providing
much needed help. On Saturday, March 29, an ecumenical group of volunteers from the area
will head down to the Boistfort Valley, west of Chehalis, to help with clean up and
rebuilding efforts. Construction experience is a plus but not necessary. Anyone with a
willing heart will find plenty of work to do. <i>Information</i>, <a

<p><b>WELCOME, PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN</b>. We support all of our parishioners who are
attending Mass with young children and we welcome those children into our midst. If you
find that your child needs a quiet place away from the stimulation of the Mass, please
feel free to step into the west vestibule or the cathedral chapel, where we have provided
a sound system so that you can continue to participate in the Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our worship. </p>

<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST. JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James
regularly and consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially registered. <i>We
strongly encourage you to register</i>. Registered parishioners receive important mailings
from the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are regular recipients of the
Cathedral&#146;s highly acclaimed journal <i>In Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate
their wedding at the Cathedral, and their children may attend any of the five Catholic
Rainbow Schools at parishioner rates (and become eligible for Cathedral scholarship
money). In addition, if you are a registered parishioner and use envelopes, or are on the
direct deposit program, we will mail you a quarterly report of your contributions to the
parish. Registration cards can be found in the vestibule. Please drop the completed card
in the collection basket or put it in the mail. <i>If you're not sure whether you're
registered at St. James, call the parish office at 206-622-3559</i>. </p>

    <p>We are the cathedral for the Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle and its Archbishop, The
    Most Reverend Alexander J. Brunett. We are also a parish church for a vibrant faith
    community with a long history that reaches back to Seattle&#146;s early days. </p>
    <p>We are an inner-city parish with an outreach to many who live on the edge of poverty
    and loneliness. We are a diverse community that welcomes, accepts, and celebrates the
    differences we all bring. We exist in the heart of the city, yet sometimes our
    parishioners come from considerable distances to worship here. </p>
    <p>St. James Cathedral is a crossroads where ideas and challenges both old and new are
    explored in the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. </p>
    <p>Our cathedral is also the center for many cultural and ecumenical events which both
    reflect and help to shape the fabric of a vital metropolitan community. </p>
    <p>Above all, St. James Cathedral is a community of prayer. </p>
