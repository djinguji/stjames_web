generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy in a
fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to needy
people living in the central district of our city. </p>

feel free to step into the west vestibule or the cathedral chapel, where we have provided
a sound system so that you can continue to participate in the Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our worship. <i>Please note that
babysitting is available in the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach Center during
the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses. Parents, you are welcome to stop by for a visit to our

    Our Lord is risen, offering us new joy and hope. By generously giving through Operation
    Rice Bowl, we too offered hope to the millions who benefit from the work of Catholic
    Relief Services. For six weeks we prayed for the people of Cameroon, fasted in solidarity
    with the people of Haiti, learned about the challenges people face in Mali, and gave
    sacrificially to create possibilities in India. As we celebrate the Easter Season filled
    with hope, visit <a class="navy" target="_blank" href="http://www.crs.org">www.crs.org</a>
    to learn more about global solidarity and to discover how CRS is putting our donations to

    disaster. Together, we keep on planting the seeds of real hope throughout the world and
    fostering their growth. <p><b>Congratulations! St. James contributed over $14,000 to
    Operation Rice Bowl this Lent! Thank you for your generosity!</b> </td>
