    ELECT</font></p>
    <p>This week we celebrate the third and final Scrutiny with the Gospel story of the
    raising of Lazarus. Death is our greatest fear and this story reminds us that God&#146;s
    power and mercy are greater than ANY fear, sin or pain that we have in our lives. The
    Elect are asked to think about what needs to die in their lives in order for them to
    receive the new life being offered to them in baptism. For some, the question of whether
    they even want to come out of the tomb is important, whether they are willing to risk
    coming out into the light of Christ to see what awaits them. This week they will also be
    presented with The Lord&#146;s Prayer, which teaches us that God loves as a loving father
    and will &#147;give us &#133;our daily bread&#148; and &#147;lead us from
    temptation.&#148; As they approach these last days of preparation before baptism, keep
    them in your prayers.</p>
    <p><strong>PRAYER CARDS FOR THE ELECT</strong> Thank you for keeping our Elect in your
    prayers during this season of Lent. Now is the time to turn in your <i>personalized</i>
    cards or notes for our Elect that will be distributed to them on Holy Saturday. You can
    drop off your cards in the baskets located at the place of prayer in the Cathedral, in the
    Hall during hospitality on Sunday mornings, or in the Bookstore during its regular hours. <i><b>Cards
    need to be turned in no later than Holy Thursday evening</b></i>. <i>Information</i>, <a

<p><strong>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH? </strong>You are

faith. It is a process which encompasses the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching, and
Christian values&#151;the development and deepening of a life of prayer and
action&#151;all with the support and involvement of the parish community. A new inquiry

<p><strong>THE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM</strong> is a program which encourages us all to be
good stewards of our health by participating in physical exercise. Our goal is to log
enough miles to reach Jerusalem by Easter. (Right now we&#146;re treading water off the
coast of Lisbon!) While many do this by walking, we are finding that some parishioners are
swimming, biking, treadmilling, elliptical training, and weight-training too. More
importantly, though, during the journey we are encouraged to reflect on our own call to
discipleship and see how best we might join with the disciples of Jesus as they walked
with him as &#147;followers of the way.&#148; If you have miles to log or would like more
information, we&#146;d like to hear from you! <i>Information</i>, <a
