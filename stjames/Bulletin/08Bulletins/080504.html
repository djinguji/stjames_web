<p align="center">[<i>Father Ryan&#146;s letter from last week&#146;s bulletin is

<p>April 27, 2008 </p>

<p>Dear Friends, </p>

<p>It seems altogether fitting that we mark Annual Catholic Appeal Sunday in the wake of
the visit to our country of Pope Benedict XVI. I don&#146;t know about you, but I
experienced, during those memorable days, a strong feeling of pride in being Catholic. The
Holy Father brought a message to us that was both timeless and timely. He challenged us to
probe our faith at its deepest level and not to separate our faith from the rest of our
lives. He also challenged us to renew our relationship with Jesus Christ, &quot;the way,
the truth, and the life,&quot; and to find in that relationship new and compelling reasons
for hope. He reminded us that our faith is a call to freedom &#151; a freedom not to be
confused with license but the true freedom of the children of God which is found only in
self-surrender to a loving God. </p>

<p>From the White House where he was a respected head of state, to the Vatican Embassy
where he was pastor to the hurting; from the United Nations where he spoke to the world,
to St. Patrick&#146;s Cathedral where he spoke to his own; from Ground Zero where he
prayed in silence, to Yankee Stadium where he reminded America of its true greatness
&#151; in each of those places and every place in between, Pope Benedict called us, in
humble, soft-spoken yet persuasive ways, to our true greatness, owning his own frailty in
the process and giving us courage to accept our own. All in all, it was an extraordinary
six days. A proud time to be Catholic! </p>

<p>Today, as we are asked to support the work of our church beyond the confines of St.
James Cathedral parish, we will do well to reflect a little on the privilege that is ours
to be part of a church that is truly Catholic. The Church of the Archdiocese of Seattle,
through our Archbishop, is our visible link to the universal Church. It is not only our
duty to support that Church in every way we can, but it is our privilege. To contribute
monetarily to the Church through the Archbishop&#146;s Annual Catholic Appeal is to step
up and claim with pride what it means to be Catholic. </p>

<p>In his homily at the Mass in Yankee Stadium, Pope Benedict looked to our past as a
Church in this country and reminded us of what we have accomplished. Here are a few of his
words: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>We think of the strong faith which built up the network of churches, educational,
  healthcare and social institutions which have long been the hallmark of the Church in this
  land. We think also of those countless fathers and mothers who passed on the faith to
  their children, the steady ministry of the many priests who devoted their lives to the
  care of souls, and the incalculable contribution made by so many men and women religious,
  who not only taught generations of children how to read and write, but al so inspired in
  them a lifelong desire to know God, to love him and to serve him. How many &quot;spiritual
  sacrif ices pleasing to God&quot; have been offered up in these two centuries!</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dear friends, as you consider what your gift to the Annual Catholic Appeal will be this
year, I know you will do so with an awareness that what you do and what you give is part
of a great history: a generous carrying on of what Catholic people in this country of ours
have always done to bring the gospel to life and make Jesus Christ known and loved. </p>
