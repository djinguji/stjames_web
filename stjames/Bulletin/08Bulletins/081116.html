    SUNDAY GIVING 2009</font></p>
    <p>&#147;My father was a very generous person,&#148; Rex Wardlaw said last Sunday.
    &#147;His motto about giving was simple: <i>Don&#146;t give until it hurts; give until you
    feel blessed.</i>&#148; </p>
    <p>Please accept the challenge to give &#147;until you feel blessed&#148; and drop your
    2009 commitment card in the offering basket today. If you&#146;ve never made a commitment
    to Sacrificial Giving, please consider making one this year. <i>Our goal is not a dollar
    amount</i>. Instead, we&#146;re going for 100% parishioner participation! We have a long
    way to go! </p>
