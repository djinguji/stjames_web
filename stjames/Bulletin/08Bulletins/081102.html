<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at 6:30 pm in the Cathedral, all are
invited to join in an ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight, and the music

perfect way to end a busy week. </p>

    <p><i>Each week during the coming Year of St. Paul, watch this space in the bulletin for
    reflection questions that will lead us deeper into the writings and example of St. Paul.
    You are also invited to visit the Place of Prayer in the west aisle and on the <a
    target="_stpaul" href="../../liturgy/stpaul/stpaulhome.htm">website</a>.</i> <ul>
      <li>On this All Souls Day, we read I Corinthians 15:51-57. St. Paul explores the
        &#147;mystery&#148; of death and resurrection. How have you experienced that
        &#147;mystery&#148; in your life? On this day when we pray for the dead and look forward
        to the resurrection on the last day, who do you remember in prayer? Are there moments when
        you are able to say with St. Paul, &#147;O death, where is your victory?&#148; </li>
      <li>In his writings, St. Paul often sees the spirit and the flesh in opposition. But that
        doesn&#146;t mean that our bodies don&#146;t matter. In today&#146;s reading, Paul insists
        that our bodies are with us to stay, even in the resurrection, though &#147;we will all be
        changed.&#148; How do you imagine that change that will happen on the last day? </li>

the parishes of St. Leo, Tacoma; St. Martin of Tours, Fife; and St. Hubert, Langley. </p>
