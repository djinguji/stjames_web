<p>Easter Sunday, 2008 </p>

<p>Dear Friends, </p>

<p>It is a joy to be able to welcome you to St. James Cathedral on this Easter of 2008. I
do so in the name of our Archbishop, Alexander J. Brunett, as well as in my own. </p>

<p>Of all the times we gather as Christian believers, none is more important than this
one. Easter is the greatest of all our feasts. It celebrates the Mystery that is the very
foundation of our Christian faith, for, as St. Paul wrote, &#147;<i>If Christ has not
risen, our faith is in vain</i>.&#148; (1 Cor. 15: 14) </p>

<p>But Christ <i>has</i> risen and your presence here in the Cathedral both affirms and
celebrates that most startling and enduring of all realities. While we do not see him, we
know he lives and that he is in our midst breathing life and hope into us, walking
alongside us on our pilgrimage of faith, our journey toward the Kingdom. </p>

<p>I have no way of knowing what is in your heart as you come here on this Easter Sunday
of 2008. For some, I am sure, there is joy and a keen sense of hope for the future as
Spring with all its promise bursts forth all around us; for others there may be the pain
of illness or the grief that comes from the death of someone close. For all of us there is
the painful paradox of living in a world that is incredibly beautiful yet hopelessly
violent at the same time. Death and life are never far apart in our world, it seems. But
that is not the whole story. Easter proclaims for all to hear the one thing that really
matters, the one thing we need to know above all else: that death does not have the last
word. Life does! </p>

<p>My prayer today is that you will be renewed in faith and hope as you join in worship
here at St. James Cathedral. </p>

<p>If you are a visitor, please know that you are warmly welcomed here. I hope you will
find something today that will touch your heart, awaken your spirit, and make you want to
return to this holy place again and again. If you are part of the regular family of St.
James, I take this opportunity to thank you for all the ways you make the Risen Lord Jesus
present in this parish and in this city: through your prayer, your faith, and your love
that overflows in such generous and unselfish service, especially to the poor. </p>

<p>May the blessings of the Risen Lord Jesus be yours in abundance. </p>

<p><b>Father Michael G. Ryan</b> <br>
