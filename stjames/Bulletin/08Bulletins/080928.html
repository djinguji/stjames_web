      <li>All of Paul&#146;s letters are about unity in one way or another. In today&#146;s
        reading from the letter to the Philippians, he pleads with them to &#147;complete my
        joy&#148; by being united in heart, love, mind, and thought. Why is unity so important in
        the Christian community? What does St. Paul see as the threats to unity? </li>
      <li>Paul says, &#147;humbly regard others as more important than yourselves.&#148; Scripture
        scholar Vincent Smiles has said of this passage, &#147;being humble has nothing to do with
        being a doormat. The humility Paul describes is self-sacrifice for others born out of
        unity in Christ.&#148; Have you known people who are truly humble&#151;in Paul&#146;s
        sense of the word? </li>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year because we are the Cathedral Church,
we remember in prayer at Mass and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This week we remember in
prayer the parishes of St. Matthew in Seattle, St. Gabriel in Port Orchard, St. Jerome in
Ocean Shores, St. Therese in Seattle, and St. Theresa in Federal Way. </p>

<p><b>From the Desk of the Pastor</b><br>
<i>September 28, 2008</i> </p>

<p>Dear Friends, </p>

<p>It is always a privilege to be able to welcome new members into the Full Communion of
the Catholic Church. This weekend&#146;s group is a small one but no less significant for
that. At the Sunday evening Mass, Jenohn Thogerson and Adrienne Krieger will make their
Profession of Faith with all of you and then receive the sacraments of Confirmation and
Holy Eucharist. Please join me in praying for them and in welcoming them to the Church and
to our parish. </p>

<p>We are well aware that our St. James Cathedral Lecture with Sister Helen Prejean,
scheduled for this coming Thursday evening at 7:30pm, is on the same night as the
Vice-Presidential Debate. As I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, we chose the date long
before the political parties settled on the same one. But we&#146;ve come up with a good
plan to resolve the conflict. The debate begins at 6:00pm and we will be able to watch it
together in the Pastoral Outreach Center, Community Room. Feel free to bring a brown bag
lunch if you like. In some ways, that should be more interesting than watching it home
alone! Following the debate, Sister Helen will present her lecture in Cathedral Hall. </p>

<p>After nearly 30 weddings since the first of June, and many more funerals than we
usually have during the summer months, I&#146;m ready for some vacation! Among other
things, I&#146;m looking forward to spending some days with good friends in Italy and to
baptizing their new daughter. I&#146;ll be remembering you in prayer from afar and will
look forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks. </p>
