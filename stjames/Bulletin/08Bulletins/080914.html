<p><b>WELCOME:</b> If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know how welcome
you are &#150; whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city. </p>

<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b> are in memory of David Pettigrew on his birthday and
also of Ed Lynch, Marna Pettigrew&#146;s father. Flowers are also from the Saturday
wedding of Ariadna Archer and Remi Gunsett. </p>

    <p><i>Each week during the coming Year of St. Paul, watch this space in the bulletin for

      <li>On this Feast of the Triumph of the Cross, we hear a hymn or canticle from St.
        Paul&#146;s letter to the Philippians (2:6-11). The first part of the poem focuses on the
        humility of Christ, who emptied himself to take on our human flesh. The second part speaks
        of God&#146;s action, raising Christ from death. At the very center, the turning point of
        the poem, is the word &#147;cross.&#148; When in your life have you encountered the cross?
        How did the encounter transform you? </li>
      <li>St. Paul tells the Philippians, &#147;have among yourselves the same attitude that is
        also yours in Christ Jesus&#148; (Philippians 2:5). What do today&#146;s readings reveal
        about Christ&#146;s &#147;attitude&#148;? If we had that same attitude, what might be
        different about the way we live our lives? </li>

<p><b>From the Desk of the Pastor</b></p>

<p>September 14, 2008 </p>

<p>Dear Friends, </p>

<p>I&#146;m writing this on a beautiful Indian summer day that is considerably nicer than
almost any day we had this past summer. In fact, I feel like I should put
&#147;summer&#148; in quotation marks! But whether it seemed like summer or not, it&#146;s
almost over and fall is taking over nicely. </p>

<p>It&#146;s always nice to be able to share good news. Two weekends ago, Paul Wilkes, a
nationally acclaimed writer and filmmaker, was with us to speak about the Home of Hope, an
orphanage for poor and abused girls in the south of India. At latest count, your gifts to
this wonderful cause came to over $40,000, a remarkable response, but not a surprising one
to someone who has been around long enough to know the generosity of the people of St.
James Cathedral. And, in case you&#146;re curious, it does look like there will be a cow
named Mike. I can&#146;t wait to get a picture! </p>

<p>The Archbishop Hunthausen Charity Golf Tournament is a week from Monday. It&#146;s not
too late to sign up to play and, for the non-golfers among you, the dinner afterwards has
become a most enjoyable parish social event. Newcastle Golf Club is stunning, the dinner
will be delicious, the auction fun, and the cause (our social outreach programs)
couldn&#146;t be better. (Registration materials are in today&#146;s bulletin.) </p>

<p>Last week many of you took advantage of the opportunity to contribute to the campaign
to defeat I-1000, the ballot initiative that would legalize physician-assisted suicide. On
Monday evening, October 7, at 7:00 pm you will have an opportunity to learn more about the
Initiative and the Church&#146;s position from Sister Sharon Park, OP, Executive Director
of the Washington State Catholic Conference. Sister Sharon is coordinating the response of
the Catholic bishops of the State of Washington and is extremely articulate on the
subject. Her presentation should be well worth hearing. The following Monday, October 14,
Patty Bowman, director of Cathedral outreach ministries, will give a follow-up talk on the
&#147;consistent ethic of life,&#148; the Church&#146;s approach to a whole host of
important questions that deal with the unique value of each and every human life. Both of
these presentations are part of our Respect Life Month observance and should be very
timely in light of the coming elections. </p>

<p>And speaking of &#147;life&#148; questions: Sister Helen Prejean, who became famous
some years ago for her book (later a movie) &#147;Dead Man Walking,&#148; will present the
<b>second annual St. James Cathedral Lecture at 7:30 pm in Cathedral Hall on Thursday
evening, October 2</b>. You may remember that Vatican correspondent, John Allen, presented
the first of these lectures last year at this time. It is a rare privilege for us to be
able to host Sister Helen. Her message is a powerful one and a timely one, too. Because it
will take place the same evening as the Vice-Presidential Debate between Senator Biden and
Governor Palin (bad timing on our part, I know, but we had our event scheduled long before
the debate!), we are going to make a &#145;package deal&#146; of the evening: from
6:00-7:30 pm, those who wish to may gather in the Pastoral Outreach Center to watch the
debate on TV. Feel free to bring a brown bag lunch if you like. Following the debate,
Sister Helen will present her lecture. Any way you look at it, this will be a memorable
evening! </p>

<p>Keep your seatbelts fastened. It&#146;s going to be a busy fall! </p>
