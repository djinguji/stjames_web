      <li>In today&#146;s second reading from the letter to the Romans (8: 9, 11-13), Paul

      <li>For St. Paul, everything revolves around Christ. Nicholas King has commented, &#147;it

<p><b>WELCOME, PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN</b>. We support all of our parishioners who are
attending Mass with young children and we welcome those children into our midst. If you
find that your child needs a quiet place away from the stimulation of the Mass, please
feel free to step into the west vestibule or the cathedral chapel, where we have provided
a sound system so that you can continue to participate in the Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our worship. </p>

<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST. JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James

strongly encourage you to register.</i> Registered parishioners receive important mailings
from the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are regular recipients of the
Cathedral&#146;s quarterly journal <i>In Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate their
wedding at the Cathedral, and their children may attend any of the five Catholic Rainbow
Schools at parishioner rates (and become eligible for Cathedral scholarship money). In
addition, if you are a registered parishioner and use envelopes, or are on the direct
debit program, we will mail you a quarterly report of your contributions to the parish.
Registration cards can be found in the vestibule. Please drop the completed card in the
collection basket or put it in the mail. <i>If you&#146;re not sure whether you&#146;re

    <p>We are the cathedral for the Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle and its Archbishop, The
    Most Reverend Alexander J. Brunett. We are also a parish church for a vibrant faith
    community with a long history that reaches back to Seattle&#146;s early days. </p>
    <p>We are an inner-city parish with an outreach to many who live on the edge of poverty
    and loneliness. We are a diverse community that welcomes, accepts, and celebrates the
    differences we all bring. We exist in the heart of the city, yet sometimes our
    parishioners come from considerable distances to worship here. </p>
    <p>St. James Cathedral is a crossroads where ideas and challenges both old and new are
    explored in the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. </p>
    <p>Our cathedral is also the center for many cultural and ecumenical events which both
    reflect and help to shape the fabric of a vital metropolitan community. </p>
    <p>Above all, St. James Cathedral is a community of prayer. </p>

prayer the parishes of St. Benedict in Seattle and St. Anne Mission in Blaine and Tulalip.
