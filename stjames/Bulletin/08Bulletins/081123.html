<p><strong>FROM THE DESK OF THE PASTOR</strong> </p>

<p>November 23, 2008 </p>

<p>Dear Friends, </p>

<p>I want to thank every one of you who has made a Sacrificial Giving commitment to the
parish for the coming year. For some of you, given the precarious situation with the
economy, making a commitment this year was also making an act of faith. Your sacrifice is
personally very moving to me and I am deeply grateful. Many of you who always make a
commitment have yet to do so and I encourage you to do so this week if at all possible. <i>And,
then, to those of you who have not been in the habit of participating in Sacrificial
Giving, I make an earnest plea that you consider doing so this year and that you do it in
a way that will involve some sacrifice</i>. Too many of us are still content to make our
parish giving an <i>afterthought</i> instead of a <i>planned thought</i> and this usually
results in dropping a dollar or two in the collection basket when it comes around. Of
course, if that represents a sacrifice, I understand, but I don&#146;t think it always
does &#150; not when you consider that many of us think little or nothing of spending
significant amounts to buy a latte, an article of clothing, a DVD, the latest electronic
gadget, or even a new car. Considering the cost of such things, I hope you will agree with
me that a weekly <i>planned</i> gift to your parish &#150; made out of gratitude to God
for all God&#146;s gifts in your life &#150; isn&#146;t asking too much. </p>

<p>This Saturday morning, November 22, I am in Milwaukee attending the ordination to the
Diaconate of one of our parishioners, Todd Strange. Todd is known to many of you since he
served here as a Eucharistic minister for a number of years. He is a wonderful young man,
a gifted minister, and a product of our RCIA! His ordination is taking place at Sacred
Heart Seminary near Milwaukee. Todd will be ordained to the priesthood here in the
Cathedral in June and will celebrate his Mass of Thanksgiving here on the Feast of Corpus
Christi. I know he will be grateful for your prayers. </p>

<p>As always, it will be a joy to gather with you here in the Cathedral at 9:30 am on
Thanksgiving Day to celebrate our annual Thanksgiving Mass. This Mass is always one of the
high points of the year for me and I know it is for many of you. I know I don&#146;t need
to encourage the hundreds of you who come for this Mass every year because you would never
miss it. But to those of you who have never been to this Mass, I would offer a word of
invitation and encouragement. It will quickly become an indispensable part of your
Thanksgiving celebration! To all who do come, a reminder that at the Offertory we always
invite people to come to the altar with their gifts of non-perishable food items which
will be shared with a local food bank. Happy Thanksgiving! </p>

<p><b>WELCOME:</b> If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know how welcome
you are &#150; whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city. </p>

<p><b>YOUNG ADULTS (21-35)</b> our &#147;Fourth Sunday&#148; faith-based gathering is
today, November 23, immediately following 5:30 Mass. This is open to all young adults ages
21-35, single or married. Our topic for the evening is one of your top choices from our
September survey: Science and Faith. The evening will be facilitated by Julia Richardt, a
Catholic actively involved in her faith and who works in the sciences. Enter the
discussion of this one world, not two worlds, where science and faith do not need to be at
odds. Join us in the Fireside Room of the Pastoral Outreach Center. Newcomers and those
not new to the parish are all welcome! <i>Information</i> <a

volunteers contributed over 125 hours of service. If you are interested in joining them in
this rewarding ministry, please come to the Orientation to be held in the Pastoral
Outreach Center on Tuesday, December 9 at 6:30 pm. (If you are in need of assistance

      <li>In the second reading, St. Paul makes it clear where Christ&#146;s kingship comes from:
        from his death on the cross and his resurrection to new life. What does this say about the
        kingship of Christ? Is Christ king in your life? </li>
      <li>The Fathers of the Second Vatican Council wrote: &#147;Now Christ has communicated this
        royal power to His disciples that they might be constituted in royal freedom and that
        &#133; they might conquer the reign of sin in themselves. He has shared this power so that
        serving Christ in others, they might by humility and patience lead their brothers and
        sisters to that King for whom to serve is to reign.&#148; (<i>Lumen Gentium</i> 36). How
        do you serve others? How does your service help you to feel part of the building of
        God&#146;s kingdom? </li>
