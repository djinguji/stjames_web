    ELECT</font></p>
    <p>Beginning this week, our newly Elect are wearing brown robes while attending Mass and
    other liturgies during Lent. This helps them to know, in a concrete way, that they have
    entered a new and significant stage in their final preparations for Easter. It also
    anticipates another change that will take place when they emerge from the baptismal waters
    at the Easter Vigil and change to white robes. Seek them out in our midst and, if
    possible, introduce yourself to them after Mass. Let them know you are praying for them
    and looking forward to Easter when they will join us at the Eucharistic table. </p>
    <p><b>LENTEN PRAYER PARTNERS FOR THE ELECT</b>. The Church tells us that it is the <i>entire</i>
    parish&#146;s responsibility to support and welcome those preparing for baptism this
    Easter. One of the many ways you can do this is to become a prayer partner for one of our
    Elect. You are asked to pray every day for him/her during Lent, asking for God&#146;s
    blessings and guidance. Also, notes and cards will be collected during Holy Week to be
    given to the Elect before Easter. Prayer cards are available at the place of prayer
    located in the north aisle of the west nave of the Cathedral (where you can also learn
    more about each of them in our Book of the Elect), in the bookstore, and in Cathedral Hall
    during Sunday morning hospitality. You can also meet our Elect by going to our <a
    href="../../Events/2008/elect2008.htm">parish website</a>. Your prayers make a difference! <i>Information</i>

<p><b>MIDDAY PRAYER</b>. Each weekday at 12:10 pm in the Chapel, we gather to pray the

prayer, and is prayed daily by bishops, priests, and religious throughout the world. All
are welcome. </p>

    Catholic Relief Services invites us to make this journey in solidarity with our global
    family, and Operation Rice Bowl makes this easy and enriching. It is a journey of prayer,
    fasting, learning and giving, all with an international flavor. To be Catholic means to be
    linked not just to our local communities, but also to our global community. Last year, the
    $8 million offered by participants in Operation Rice Bowl made a huge difference to people
    all around the world. Our participation in Operation Rice Bowl during this Lenten season
    will challenge us to expand our own horizons. We will be provoked to alleviate suffering

<p><b>FROM THE DESK OF THE PASTOR</b> </p>

<p>February 10, 2008 </p>

<p>Dear Friends, </p>

<p>It&#146;s not unusual, after the Christmas season, to have someone remark to me,
&#147;Well, now that your busy season is over&#133;.&#148; That&#146;s the common
perception for sure, but it doesn&#146;t really reflect the situation at St. James. In
fact, I have come to believe that there is no season around here that is not busy!
That&#146;s partly why St. James Cathedral is such an exciting and vibrant place. </p>

<p>Take this past week. On Tuesday, we were privileged to play host to Olivier Latry, the
Titular Organist of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris. To have M. Latry play here at
St. James was something of a coup, I would say, and the concert he presented demonstrated
not only his remarkable skills but also the glories of the two Cathedral organs. Lucky for
us, of course, we are regularly spoiled around here by the extraordinary gifts of our two
highly gifted Cathedral organists&#133;. </p>

<p>The next day, Ash Wednesday, saw huge numbers of people crowding the Cathedral morning,
noon, and night. Counting the mid-morning Mass for the O&#146;Dea High School students,
there were well over 3,000 people in the Cathedral on Ash Wednesday -- a hopeful and
impressive beginning to the season of Lent and a wonderful testimonial to faith. </p>

<p>The next day we hosted another major gathering in the Cathedral &#150; the first of
three Rites of Election for catechumens from parishes around the Archdiocese. The
Cathedral was full to overflowing Thursday evening as Archbishop Brunett welcomed hundreds
of people, including a large group from our own parish, who will be baptized during the
coming Easter Vigil. Two more of these Rites of Election will be held on Monday and
Wednesday of this coming week. If you are looking for signs of hope for the Church, this
surely has to be one of them! </p>

<p>As part of our parish&#146;s Lenten journey, we launched this past week another round
of &#147;Putting God First.&#148; I&#146;m happy to share with you that 65 of your fellow
parishioners accepted the invitation to participate in this five-week retreat program that
gathers people in small groups with other parishioners to talk about faith and
discipleship. &#147;Putting God First&#148; is a St. James Cathedral &#145;original&#146;
that began nearly two years ago. To date, more than 300 people have participated in it and
they would be the first to tell you that it has been a wonderful spark to their growth in
faith. More opportunities are planned for the future. </p>

<p>The first lap of my personal Lenten journey will be some days of retreat at a
Benedictine Abbey in England. I&#146;m looking forward to the opportunity to idle my
engines for awhile and to plug into the prayerful rhythm of the monastic community of
Downside Abbey. You can be sure that I will be remembering you in prayer during my days
away. </p>
