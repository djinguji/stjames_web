<p><strong>FROM THE DESK OF THE PASTOR</strong> </p>

<p>December 16, 2007 </p>

<p>Dear Friends, </p>

<p>Next weekend, we will put the finishing touches on our Cathedral Centennial
celebration. Archbishop Brunett will preside and preach at the evening Mass on Saturday,
December 22, the actual day, one-hundred years ago, on which Bishop O&#146;Dea dedicated
the Cathedral. Following the Mass, he will lead a procession outside to the Archbishop
Murphy Courtyard where he will bless the huge granite <i>mensa</i> or altar-top of the
Cathedral&#146;s original altar, consecrated by Bishop O&#146;Dea on that December day so
long ago. When we renovated the Cathedral in 1994, this huge piece of granite that was the
high altar was removed and placed in storage. Now it will be mounted in the courtyard on
the outer wall of the Cathedral with an inscription that will recall important milestones
in the Cathedral&#146;s long and blessed history. </p>

<p>A similar blessing will take place on Sunday morning, December 23, after the 10:00
Mass. </p>

<p>I know you will do your best to be here for one of these historic celebrations, and I
also know I can count on you to pray for good weather! </p>

<p>May these remaining days of Advent deepen within you a longing for Christ&#146;s coming
among us at Christmas! </p>

<p>Father Michael G. Ryan<br>
<em>Cathedral Pastor</em></p>

<p>P.S. Since, after many months of searching, we have yet to locate the cornerstone
Bishop O&#146;Dea laid in 1905, maybe we can think of the granite altar he dedicated in
1907 as the cornerstone for the next hundred years!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>WELCOME!</strong> If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know
how welcome you are&#151;whether you have come from another part of the country, from
across the world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part,
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city. </p>
