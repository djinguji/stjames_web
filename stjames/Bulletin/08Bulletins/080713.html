    <p><i>Each week during the coming Year of St. Paul, watch this space in the bulletin for
    reflection questions that will lead us deeper into the writings and example of St. Paul.
    You are also invited to visit the Place of Prayer in the west aisle and on the <a

      <li>Last week, we heard about the tension between &#147;flesh&#148; and &#147;spirit.&#148;
        This week (Romans 8: 18-23), Paul continues to explore that tension. Though we have
        received &#147;the firstfruits of the Spirit,&#148; we do not have the Spirit in its
        fullness. We continue to suffer and struggle, but with a new hope. If you had to explain <i>your</i>
        hope in Christ, what would you say? </li>
      <li>St. Paul tells us that not only human beings, but all of creation shares in the
        &#147;sufferings of the present time,&#148; and awaits the glory that is to come. How
        might these words help us to reflect on the present environmental crisis? </li>
