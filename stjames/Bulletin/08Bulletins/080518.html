<p><b>WELCOME!</b> If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know how welcome
you are &#151; whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy in a
fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to needy
people living in the central district of our city. </p>

<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b> are from the Saturday wedding of Arlene Nobleza and
Derek Silverio. Flowers are also from the Quintana-Leon family in memory of Steven W.
Cather. <i>Floral offerings are a venerable custom in the Church, and a wonderful way to
remember a deceased loved one, celebrate an anniversary, or give thanks for an answered
prayer. There are still several weekends available during the coming months. Information <a

<p><b>THE WAY OF COMPANIONSHIP</b>. How can we reach out with love to those who are
hurting? How can I see the face of Christ in the face of a homeless person? There are many
times when we are called up to listen to another person, to hear their story and to offer
some kind of help or support. Craig Rennebohm from the Mental Health Chaplaincy will
present a training in the practice of companionship, a way of being gently present to
another and sharing a little of the journey together. Tuesday, June 3, 7:00 pm in the

    the sunshine. Weather permitting, the Sunday morning coffee hours will take place in the
    Archbishop Murphy courtyard starting on June 1 and continuing through Labor Day weekend.
    But this can only happen with your help. Hosting coffee hour outdoors requires extra
    hands, and our regular coffee hour crew is already stretched. If you have enjoyed the
    summer coffee hour in the past, would you please consider helping us bring it back? We are
    looking for several outgoing people to help with set-up, serving and clean-up for this
    very important ministry of hospitality. It&#146;s fun, it&#146;s easy, and you might even
    get a suntan! <i>Information</i>, <a
