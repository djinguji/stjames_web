us to care for the widows, the orphans and the strangers. Who are these people in our

questions through reflection, study, prayer, and community. There are still a couple of

      <li>St. Paul&#146;s letter to the Romans (9: 1-5) speaks of the gifts God has lavished on
        the Jewish people. Where does St. Paul find God&#146;s presence, in the history and life
        of his &#147;kindred,&#148; the Israelites? </li>
      <li>St. Paul speaks of his &#147;great sorrow and constant anguish&#148; at seeing his
        fellow Israelites &#147;cut off from Christ.&#148; All of us have suffered at not being
        able to share our faith with those we love, sometimes those closest to us. What is
        Paul&#146;s response to this dilemma? What might ours be? </li>
