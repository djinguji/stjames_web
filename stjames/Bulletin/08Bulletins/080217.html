    ELECT</font></p>
    <p>Lent is a particularly special time for the Elect who have been journeying towards
    baptism, Eucharist and confirmation at the Easter Vigil. As part of their preparation, the
    Church celebrates anointing with the oil of the Catechumen, blessings and exorcisms.
    Beginning next Sunday, we will join in prayer for our Elect as they participate in the
    ancient ceremonies called the Scrutinies that symbolize the spiritual purification taking
    place in their lives as they prepare for baptism. Through these Scrutinies, blessings and
    anointings, the Elect are encouraged to reflect more deeply on their own spiritual
    challenges and weaknesses. At the same time, these rites offer powerful prayers of faith,
    hope and strength on their behalf, calling upon God&#146;s grace and mercy to penetrate
    their entire lives. Please continue to keep them in your prayers. </p>
    <p><b>LENTEN PRAYER PARTNERS FOR THE ELECT</b>. It is not too late to &#147;adopt&#148;
    one of our Elect as they prepare to celebrate the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation and
    Eucharist. You are asked to pray everyday for him/her asking for God&#146;s blessings and
    guidance. Also, notes and cards will be collected during Holy Week to be given to the
    Elect before Easter. Prayer cards are available at the place of prayer located in the
    north aisle of the west nave of the Cathedral (where you can also learn more about each of
    them in our Book of the Elect), in the bookstore, and in Cathedral Hall during Sunday
    morning hospitality. You can also meet our Elect by going to our <a
    href="../../Events/2008/elect2008.htm">parish website</a>. Your prayers make a difference! <i>Information</i>
