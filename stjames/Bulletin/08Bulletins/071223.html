<p><b>FLOOD RELIEF COLLECTION</b>. On Sunday, December 9, the Cathedral parish

following all Masses last Sunday) to flood relief as well. That means St. James
parishioners have contributed a total of <b>$15,524</b> to help our neighbors rebuild.
What an amazing testimonial to the generosity of this parish! Thank you. </p>

<p><b>ST. JAMES IN THE MEDIA</b>. The Seattle P-I&#146;s Richard Campbell attended the

church service, with all the dignity and eloquence for which the First Hill Catholic
cathedral is known,&#148; he wrote. &#147;Christmas never felt better.&#148; Link to <a
