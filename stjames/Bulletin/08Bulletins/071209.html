<p><strong>WELCOME!</strong> If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know
how welcome you are&#151;whether you have come from another part of the country, from
across the world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part,
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city. </p>

transept? <i>This is your chance to find out! This is the last of our ten-minute tours,
which have been offered on the second and fourth Sundays of the month throughout our
Centennial Year 2007</i>. </p>
