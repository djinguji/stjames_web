<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a middle-aged man who 
supplements his modest Social Security Disability Income with part-time wages. 
For years he worked hard with doctors to stabilize his ongoing health problems 
enough so he could start working more hours. But he did not realize that his 
monthly premiums for health insurance would increase as his wages went up. 
Suddenly he was confronted with a past-due bill for three months of higher 
premiums. Unable to pay both his rent and the higher premiums, he asked for our 
help, and we gave him enough rent to get caught up. Thanks to your donations, he 
should be able to keep up with his expenses going forward!

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
middle-aged man who earned enough money to live on
until the moment he was struck by an uninsured “hit &
run” driver as he walked across the street. Serious
injuries kept him in the hospital for months and then in
a wheelchair for a year, needing constant care. When
we visited, he no longer needed a wheelchair but was
still weak, sore and sleeping on an old, borrowed
mattress on the floor. Also on the floor, near the head
of his bed, was a chemical powder running along the
baseboard trim. The powder was from a recent
(successful) attempt to rid the apartment of roaches.
Despite his circumstances, the man displayed a
positive attitude, smiling when he said, “Things could
be worse!” We gave him a proper new bed, up off the
floor, and he now sleeps better and with less pain.
Your support made this possible – thank you!

Dear Friends,<p>In light of the front-page story in the Seattle
Times this past Wednesday, many have asked about
how settlement payments are made for clergy
sexual abuse cases in the Archdiocese of Seattle.</p>
<p>According to information furnished by the
Archdiocese, since the late 1980’s, some $100
million has been paid out in settlements for
approximately 440 claims of sexual abuse of
minors. Shocking as this is, it is important to note
that all of these settlements involve incidents dating
from 30 to 60 years ago. Settlements that were
made directly with survivors, as well as those
resulting from litigation, are included in this
number.</p>
<p>The question arises as to where the money
came for the settlements. These payments have
come from insurance carriers, the archdiocese’s self
-insurance plan, and the sale of archdiocesan-held
property. The only sense in which parish assets are
involved is that we, along with other parishes and
Catholic institutions, pay an annual Archdiocesan
assessment out of which the insurance premiums
are paid.</p>
<p>I know it must seem that this scandal and the
fallout from it will never end. I know I feel that
way. But I am also prayerfully hopeful that we are
moving toward the light of day and that these
settlements will bring a modicum of peace and
closure to the victims and their families.</p>

<p><b>KITCHEN VOLUNTEERS NEEDED</b>. The Cathedral
Kitchen needs a Tuesday gleaner. Gleaners go out in
the morning to local supermarkets and collect food
(fruits, vegetables, milk, deli items, etc.) These items
are used in our daily meals. It’s a fun and rewarding
outreach! We also need a few more volunteers to help
with cooking, preparing, serving meals, and clean-up.

<p><b>SUPPORTING MARRIAGES</b>. Did you know the Catholic
Church really cares about your marriage and wants it
to succeed? And did you know that St. James
Cathedral parish is committed to helping married
couples live out their vocation? Good marriages can
always be made better! Pope Francis described
marriage as “a project to be worked on together” and a
“process of growth” (<i>Amoris Laetitia</i>, no. 218, 221).
We know that a good number of our couples are
without the support of extended family because they
are ‘transplants’ to the Seattle area. All the more
reason for our parish to offer opportunities to connect
with others who are in the same boat and to build
community in the process!</p>

		<p>If you have looked at the Cathedral towers in
the last couple of weeks, you may have noticed
some scaffolding hanging down from the upper
levels. And, if you look today and compare the
north and south towers you will notice a
significantly cleaner and brighter look on the north
tower terra cotta.</p>
<p>We are in the process of finishing up a two-year
program of refurbishment and repair of the
upper levels of the towers. This has involved
extensive masonry and terra cotta work,
waterproofing, and applying a special water proof
paint. As you might imagine, the upkeep of an
historic 111-year-old building does not come
cheap! Last year’s phase came to about $140,000
and this year’s will be about $155,000.</p>
<p>It’s thanks to your generosity that we have
been able to complete this important work. A
special thanks to all who contributed to this year’s
Annual Catholic Appeal. The parish rebate (which
ended up totalling $173,172!) is covering most of
the costs of the work.</p>

parish residents, two Vincentians go together to their
homes for a friendly visit. On one recent evening we
made three stops, visiting a nanny, an artist/musician
and a security guard – all currently employed. Each
tries hard to make ends meet, but each needed rent
help (which we gave) due to unexpected expenses, too
few work hours or low wages. All three spontaneously
displayed wonderful attitudes: upbeat, positive, with
hope in their hearts and very grateful for the help. As
Vincentians, we see the difficult circumstances faced
by those needing help, but when we meet them in
person, we also see the beauty, strength and resilience
of their humanity. Thank you for your support!

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A young, single
dad had to put his 2-year-old daughter into daycare
because grandma had to stop babysitting to focus on
caring for grandpa, who had become ill. Putting the
little girl into daycare required dad to stop commuting
to work by bus because the only way he can pick her
up and drop her off at daycare on time is by driving.
Dad loves his job helping homeless families find
housing and rebuild their lives, but his modest
paycheck was strained to the breaking point by
daycare costs and commuting expense. With your
donations, we paid enough rent to avoid eviction,
buying dad time to get back on track financially.

<p><b>PREPARES VOLUNTEERS ACCOMPANY YOUNG
FAMILY</b>. Our new Pregnancy and Parenting Support
Program (PREPARES) is establishing supportive
relationships with parents and families throughout our
community. Here is a recent account from a volunteer
couple: “Six months ago my husband and I were
partnered with a family who had come to Catholic
Community Services for help with food and clothing.
The parents of a 6-month old had been homeless and
had suffered from problems with addiction, but now
had been clean and sober for two years. They
continued to follow up with their recovery program,
but with very limited family, this was their only
support system. As PREPARES volunteers, our role is
to be supportive and non-judgmental companions to
these parents. We meet weekly to go to the food bank,
share a meal or cup of coffee, or just go for a walk. We
strive to be good friends and listeners. Recently we
attended the birthday party for their now 1-year old
toddler, who is a beautiful and happy little boy.”</p>

<p><b>SURVIVING SUICIDE</b> Sunday, January 28, 1:30pm,
Pastoral Outreach Center. If you have lost a loved one
to suicide – you are a survivor of suicide. A survivor
can be a spouse or partner, child, sibling, friend.
Common feelings include shock, anger, guilt,
depression, confusion and shame. Laura Takacs MPH,
LICSW - clinical director of Virginia Mason’s
Separation and Loss Services, will be addressing the
grief cycle associated with traumatic loss. She will
also talk about a therapeutic model known as
Restorative Retelling groups – with a healing focus on
restoring resilience by honoring the memory of your
loved one and sharing common experiences in a
supportive environment. <i>Information</i>,

Annual General Meeting in
September. This year, we
sponsored a spirited debate
between Jenny Durkan and

called “the raucous exercise of their First Amendment
rights.” People from the SHARE/Nickelsville group
attended as well as many parishioners and other
interested citizens. Plans are already underway for next
year’s Annual Meeting. If you are interested in the

Try to eliminate as much disposable plastic from your

and reuse plastic sandwich and snack bags, or try
replacing them with waxed paper or waxed-paper
bags, which can be composted.</p>

Make it a priority to increase your use of public
transportation. Buses and light rail are operating anyway,
so making use of them instead of your car — even just two
or three times a month — is a step in reducing emissions
and congestion. You might find it easy enough to do even
more often.</p>

“In the family we first learn how to show love and
respect for life; we are taught the proper use of things,
order and cleanliness, respect for the local ecosystem
and care for all creatures... In the family we learn to
ask without demanding, to say thank you as an
expression of genuine gratitude for what we have been
given, to control our aggressivity and greed, and to ask
forgiveness when we have caused harm. These simple
gestures… help to create a culture of shared life and
respect for our surroundings.” (<i>Laudato Si’</i>, 213)</p>

The incident occurred on August 14, near Chaghcharan, the capital city of Ghor province, an
area once relatively peaceful but now home to active
Taliban and Islamic State militants. “We are shocked
and heartbroken over the loss of our colleagues in
Afghanistan,” CRS spokeswoman Megan Gilbert said
in a statement. “Our staff dedicate their lives to
helping others, and we will always be grateful for their
tremendous service to people in need.” “I call on all
parties to ensure that those providing humanitarian
assistance have safe access to the most vulnerable and
can carry out their lifesaving work unhindered,” U.N.
humanitarian coordinator in Afghanistan Richard
Peeperkorn said in a statement about the CRS attack.
CRS provides humanitarian aid to more than 200,000

disaster response. Please keep these staff and their
families in your thoughts and prayers. This was written

<p><b>REFLECTION ON HOMELESSNESS</b>. One of our
parishioners who is a member of the St. James
Housing Advocacy Committee regularly visits a
homeless encampment near her home. She drops off
sandwiches and warm clothes, after which, she says, “I
get in my warm car and drive away in the cold rain,”
grateful for the many blessings she enjoys in her own
life. Recently, she decided to stay and get acquainted
with some of the people in the camp. Contrary to the
disdainful remarks she often hears about people
experiencing homelessness – “lazy”, “alcoholics”,
“losers” – she meets families, like the one from New
Mexico who moved to Seattle searching for work, only
to find there were no jobs. Faced with a prohibitive
cost of living, they became homeless. The St. James
parishioner also met a Seattle woman with two young
children who lost her job, and then her apartment.
Many of the people in the encampment had never
experienced homelessness before, and never even
contemplated the possibility that they would find
themselves living in a tent. Most are determined to do
whatever it takes to find work and settle into a real
home. The parishioner left that day with a new sense
of urgency, and a determination to advocate with
compassion for those in our community who
experience homelessness.</p>

Talk with fellow parishioners about the possibility of
sharing rides to Mass and other parish events as a way
of reducing your carbon footprint. You can take this a
step further by organizing occasional walk-to-church
weekends. This would be a blessed opportunity to
extend the Camino experience!</p>

		<p><b>THANK YOU FROM THE WINTER SHELTER</b>. Our
Winter Shelter is now closed for the summer. We were
open from September until this past April for 116
nights, and invited about 14 men each evening. That
means we welcomed about 1,624 men over the age of
50 into our midst. Thank you to all our volunteers who
made this happen! During the summer months, you
can still help out–while you are travelling, be sure to
pick up hotel toiletries and then drop them off at
Sunday Coffee Hour or at the Parish Office.</p>

	<p><b>ROSARY</b>. All are welcome to join with a group of
parishioners who pray the rosary together in the
Chapel, Monday through Saturday at 7:40am.</p>

<p><b>CD OF SUNDAY MASS</b>. Do you know someone who is
unable to attend Sunday Mass but would appreciate
staying connected by listening to the Mass on CD?
Each Sunday, a faithful volunteer records and masters
the 10:00am Mass, including the music, prayers,
reading, and homilies. This CD is mailed at no charge
to homebound parishioners and to “long-distance”
parishioners around the country, along with a Sunday
bulletin. If you or someone you know would like to be
added to the list, contact

Mary Shrine, available to answer questions, accept
prayer requests, and greet visitors who stop in
between 1:00pm-4:00pm. It’s a quiet time to pray,
read, and be present to those who come to the

		Dear Friends,<p>This weekend, we mark Earth Day on
April 22. As people of God, it is our duty to
work to become better stewards of the Earth.
In Pope Francis’ message to mark last year’s
World Day of Prayer for the Care for
Creation, he wrote that, “It is also
encouraging that throughout the world…
initiatives promoting environmental justice,
concern for the poor and responsible social
commitment have been bringing together
people, especially young people, from
diverse religious backgrounds. Christians or
not, as people of faith and goodwill, we
should be united in showing mercy to the
earth as our common home and cherishing
the world in which we live as a place for
sharing and communion.”</p>
<p>Next Sunday, our Care for Creation
committee invites all of us to an
Environmental Fair in Cathedral Hall. Let’s
take this opportunity to learn ways we can
be more mindful of how our everyday
actions affect God’s Creation, and urge
businesses and our lawmakers to also treat
the Earth with respect and mercy.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Campaign planning study announcement</b></p>
<p>Over the last several years it has become
apparent that the archdiocesan priest pension
and post-retirement medical plans are seriously
underfunded. Similarly, our women religious
must rely on dwindling resources within their
own communities to meet their retirement
needs. In addition, parishes have their own
needs to address.</p>
<p>At the recommendation of the Archdiocesan
Finance Council and in dialogue with the
Presbyteral Council, the Priest Pension Board
and other leadership, Archbishop Sartain has
decided to explore the possibility of a major
campaign to address the retirement needs we
face today and are projected to face in the
future, as well as local parish needs.</p>
<p>This planning study is an assessment to
gauge support for a major campaign to address
some or all of our identified priorities. The
study is being administered by outside counsel,
the Steier Group, a Catholic development firm.
They will survey the entire archdiocese to
determine which of our needs are deemed most
urgent by parishioners, and identify potential
support of a major campaign.</p>
<p>All parishioners are invited visit the
Archdiocese of Seattle’s website to learn more

<p><b>ENCOUNTER LENT</b>, Join the St. James community—and nearly 14,000 Catholic communities across the
United States—in a life-changing Lenten journey of
encounter with the Catholic Relief Services (CRS)
Rice Bowl. Pick up your family’s CRS Rice Bowl on
Ash Wednesday or in the vestibules during Lent, and
don’t forget to download the CRS Rice Bowl app!
May these 40 days better prepare us to encounter
ourselves, our neighbors and our God.</p>
<p><b>40 DAYS FOR LIFE</b> is an international, ecumenical,
campaign of prayer to end abortion, taking place in
675 cities of 40 nations throughout the
world. Participants are encouraged to engage in prayer,
fasting, and community outreach, while maintaining a
peaceful, prayer vigil in front of an abortion facility.
The spring campaign runs from Ash Wednesday,
March 1st, through Palm Sunday, April 9. In Seattle,
the vigil will be held 7:00am to 7:00pm on the public
sidewalk in front of Planned Parenthood at 2001
Madison. The goal is to have at least two persons
engaged in prayer—not demonstrations—during each
two-hour shift. A kick-off event will be held Sunday,
February 26 from 2:00 to 4:00pm at the Greenlake
Guest House, 1911 N. 63rd St. <i>Information</i>,

as a People of God to once more encounter Lent, a
time of spiritual growth through prayer, fasting and
almsgiving. We are given forty days of opportunity to
encounter ourselves, our neighbors and our God anew.
And, on Easter Sunday, we encounter the Risen
Christ—and the hope that the Resurrection brings. Are
you ready for this journey? Catholic Relief
Services’ (CRS) Rice Bowl wants to accompany you
throughout these forty days with stories, prayers,
reflections and faith formation. Get started now by
downloading the app for Android and iPhone users and
setting a daily reminder to pray with it each day. How
will you use this Lent as a time to build a culture of
encounter—both in your local community, and in our
global one?</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>On November 20, the Jubilee Year of Mercy comes to an end. It has
been a wonderful gift to the Church from Pope Francis, who never tires of
speaking about the mercy of God. He reminds us that Mercy is God’s name.
And he reminds us, too, that God’s arms are always open and that the
embrace of God is wide beyond our imagining.</p>
<p>If you have drifted away from participating in Sunday Mass, I hope
you will consider returning. I encourage you to seek out a parish home that
nourishes you spiritually, whether here at St. James Cathedral or in your
local neighborhood.</p>
<p>If there is something that the Church has done to hurt or scandalize
you, I want to beg forgiveness in the name of the Church. And if there is
anything that we as the parish community of St. James Cathedral can do to
help you at this moment along your journey of life and faith, we very much
want to do it.</p>
<p>You are part of the great family of the Church, you are important, and
God always welcomes you with open arms. So does your Church!</p>
<p>May the amazingly good news of God’s boundless mercy touch your
heart and bring you joy and hope.</p>

		<p>St. James Cathedral, along with the other seventeen
parishes in our South Seattle Deanery, has been
working for the last year on a plan to address the
current and future shortage of priests in the
Archdiocese as well as such issues as lay
leadership, parish collaborations, and the future of
the faith communities in the central and south areas
of the City.</p>
<p>As part of this planning process, our parish
participated in the Disciple Maker Index survey in
January as well as three Deanery wide convocations
and several Focus Groups.</p>
<p>On Sunday, October 23, we will be holding
listening sessions after all three morning masses to
share with you the plan which the Deanery
leadership is submitting to Archbishop Sartain in
December. This is a chance to give your feedback

<p><b><i>WHEEL</i> IS A GRASSROOTS ORGANIZING EFFORT</b> of
homeless/formerly-homeless women, well-regarded in
Seattle. For the past 16 years they’ve operated a
loving, low-barrier, night-time women’s shelter, which
is currently seeking a new home. Starting August 1, St
James will allow use of Cathedral Hall for WHEEL, so
that 50-60 women, along with 2 WHEEL staff, may
have a safe and secure place to sleep. WHEEL will
only be here at night, and will not interrupt the daily
life of the Cathedral. Because of the Cathedral’s
commitment to the Winter Shelter, WHEEL is actively
pursuing a new and permanent host site and will stay
only until late September. If you are aware of a
possible new site in or very near to Downtown for
WHEEL, or if you have questions, contact Patrick Barredo, 206-382-4515.</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Each November our bulletin covers feature
the names of parishioners and friends who
over the past twenty-five years remembered
St. James Cathedral in their will. Each of those
names is a person, of course, and each person
had a story, and each story, in one way or
another, involved St. James Cathedral!</p>
<p>Some of their legacy gifts were large; others
were the proverbial widow’s mite; still others
were somewhere in the middle. But each gift
made a difference: each gift helped to keep the
Cathedral afloat – helped us fulfill our mission
– over these many years.</p>
<p>Every November, I take time to read those
names with care and as I do, I see familiar
faces and call to mind wonderful stories. And
I pray for each of those generous people,
giving thanks to God for them. I hope you
will do the same. We wouldn’t be what we
are without them!</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
	<p>The Super Bowl was great for Seattle but
maybe not quite so great for St. James. Put it
this way: as far as attendance is concerned (we

repeat performance. It’s all very
