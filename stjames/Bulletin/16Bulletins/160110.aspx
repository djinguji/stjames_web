<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>As we begin this new year, I want to tell you about some staff reorganization I have
decided to do in order to carry out our pastoral ministry more effectively. The decision will
eliminate one full-time staff position which, to say the least, is a painful and difficult thing
to do but, after a good deal of prayer and consultation, I have come to the conclusion that
we can better serve the parish by dividing certain of our pastoral ministries among three
ministers instead of four.</p>
<p>The ministries involved are: family ministry (including pregnancy support, ministry
to families with children, marriage enrichment ministry, ministry to divorced couples, and
ministry to senior parishioners), funeral ministry, and grief ministry. In the past, these
ministries have been led by two full-time staff members: Suzanne Lee and John Simpson.
Beginning later this month, they will be headed up by Suzanne Lee, who will share
responsibility for them with several staff members and volunteers. Difficult as this is to
say—and I say it with deep regret—this means the elimination of the position that John
Simpson has held for several years.</p>
<p>This will involve some other shifts as well. Rosanne Michaels, who heads up our
Welcome Back and adult Confirmation programs, will now take over from Suzanne Lee the
ministry to young families preparing to have their children baptized, while Kathleen
McCabe will take on teaching our baptismal preparation classes. In addition, Rosanne will
join Suzanne and Nancy Granger in leading the grief ministry group and, as needed, she
will also assist with our ministry to seniors while continuing her parish retreat ministry.</p>
<p>There are a few other aspects of pastoral ministry that still other staff members have
generously agreed to take over. Corinna Laughlin, director of liturgy, along with Peter
Burns, assistant sacristan, will oversee the task of training and coordinating ministers of
Holy Communion to visit our homebound parishioners.</p>
<p>One other aspect of this reorganization, and a happy one, will involve the use of key
volunteers to assist in some of these ministries. As you know, our parish is blessed with a
large number—an incredibly large number—of generous volunteers and I am convinced
that with the help of volunteers, we will not only maintain, but even expand the ministries
we offer.</p>
<p>Having said that, I want to acknowledge that changes are always difficult, and that
personnel changes are especially difficult. With this in mind, let me take this opportunity to
express in a public way my thanks to John Simpson for the ministry he has done so capably
over these years. I know you will join me in wishing John well and in praying that God will
open a door for him that will allow him to use his gifts for ministry. And I want also to take
this opportunity to express my thanks to Suzanne Lee, Rosanne Michaels, Kathleen
McCabe, and Peter Burns for their willingness to take on additional responsibilities.</p>
<p>Lastly, let me ask you to be patient with us as we make this transition. There may be
some growing pains at first but I am confident that, with God’s help and your
understanding and support, we will continue to provide the kind of ministry that you, the
wonderful people of this parish, deserve.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our <b>Sunday Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

<p><b>SANTO NIÑO – HOLY CHILD</b>. On Sunday, January 17, at
the Noon Mass, we will have our annual celebration of
the Santo Niño, the Holy Child Jesus. The image of Jesus
as vulnerable child and mighty King is beloved
throughout the world, and in a special way in the
Philippines. All are invited to bring their own images of
the Child Jesus from home for the blessing. The annual
celebration will be followed by a fiesta in Cathedral
Place Hall, with a marvelous feast of Filipino food
prepared by a group of our own parishioners. All are
welcome.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME BACK!</b> Have you drifted away from your
Catholic faith? Are you disillusioned by what you hear
about the church? Do you desire a life filled with faith?
St. James Cathedral offers a 9-week program for
Catholics out of touch with a Church that once may
have been home. It’s a safe place to ask questions, and
to experience a small community of faith. Winter
session begins Monday, January 11, and continues
Mondays through March. Sessions are 7:00 – 9:00 pm
in Cathedral Place. <i>Information</i>:

<p><b>ST. JAMES CATHEDRAL, ALONG WITH OTHER
PARISHES IN THE SEATTLE AREA</b>, has been invited to
participate in a national study of vibrant parishes
conducted by the Catholic Leadership Institute. All
parishioners will be invited to complete a 10-15 minute
survey online. The survey will be available from the
week of January 18 through Ash Wednesday, February
10, and will invite you to reflect on your own spiritual
growth and enable you to provide feedback about the
Cathedral parish. All responses will be strictly
confidential. The hope is that every Cathedral parishioner
will participate in the survey. This information gleaned
will be invaluable not only to the Cathedral pastoral
team, but also to the Archdiocese of Seattle as they
undertake long-term planning for the pastoral needs of
our parishes. We will receive the results this summer at
which time we will share what we have learned. More
information is coming soon. Stay tuned!</p>
<p><b>THANK YOU FROM THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN</b>. Thanks,
<b>Marci Jewelry</b> for making our Christmas Eve Dinner at

<p><b>REPORT FROM ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b>. Your SVdP donations allowed our

December and help 222 low (or no) income residents of St James Parish who 
struggle to pay for life's necessities, such as rent, electricity, beds, food, 
clothes and basic hygiene products. That's an average of about 48 home visits 
and 74 people helped per month. Even more parish residents seek our assistance – 
please help, if you can! <i>Information</i>,
