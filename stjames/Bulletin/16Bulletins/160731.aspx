<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A Capitol Hill
resident needed emergency, life-saving surgery that
left him unable to work. He lived on savings as long as
he could, but his savings ran out. He applied for
governmental assistance but was refused because one
of his doctors incorrectly reported an important fact
related to his application. With nowhere else to turn,
he called the SVdP Helpline (206-767-6449). We
visited and helped pay his rent so he would not lose
housing while he continues to seek long-term
governmental assistance. Your financial support made
our help possible – thank you!</p>
<p><b><i>WHEEL</i> IS A GRASSROOTS ORGANIZING EFFORT</b> of
homeless/formerly-homeless women, well-regarded in
Seattle. For the past 16 years they’ve operated a
loving, low-barrier, night-time women’s shelter, which
is currently seeking a new home. Starting August 1, St
James will allow use of Cathedral Hall for WHEEL, so
that 50-60 women, along with 2 WHEEL staff, may
have a safe and secure place to sleep. WHEEL will
only be here at night, and will not interrupt the daily
life of the Cathedral. Because of the Cathedral’s
commitment to the Winter Shelter, WHEEL is actively
pursuing a new and permanent host site and will stay
only until late September. If you are aware of a
possible new site in or very near to Downtown for
WHEEL, or if you have questions, contact Patrick Barredo, 206-382-4515.</p>
