<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our <b>Sunday Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

<p><b>YEAR OF MERCY</b>. We welcome all pilgrims to St. James
Cathedral during this Year of Mercy. Whether you are a
visitor or a regular at St. James, you can walk through
the Holy Doors of Mercy, the four bronze doors at the
Cathedral’s west entrance. The center doors are opened
before and after each Mass. A self-guided pilgrimage of
prayer, <i>The Way of Mercy</i>, is available as well—pick up a flyer just 
inside the Holy Doors. The banner at the ministers’
pier, by fabric artist Juanita Yoder, was commissioned
for the Year of Mercy. It suggests the overflowing streams of God’s
mercy.</p>
<p><b>PEACE—MUSIC OF THREE FAITHS</b> Saturday, March 12
and Sunday, March 13, 2016 at 8:00pm, Seattle Pro Musica. <i>Peace</i> explores the deep connections between
three Abrahamic faiths: Judaism, Christianity, and
Islam. Anchoring the program are Gloria (everywhere)
by Turkish-American composer Kamran Ince with
words by the 13th-century Sufi poet Rumi, and I sing of
love by Bernard Hughes, who weaves together texts
from Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions. The
concert also features uplifting works by Renaissance
Jewish composer Salomone Rossi and contemporary
Latvian composer &#274;rik Ešenvalds, along with Islamic
and Maronite chants. <i>Information and passes</i>,

for you as soon as Mass begins. Come on your own, as
a couple, or as a family! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST. JAMES CATHEDRAL CARE FOR CREATION
COMMITTEE CELEBRATES EARTH HOUR 2016</b>.
The global movement for raising awareness on climate
change is coming to St. James Saturday, March 19!
Earth Hour started in 2007 with one city; in 2016,
people from over 7,000 cities and 192 countries will
join in powering down the lights to turn on action for
climate change. For the first time, the exterior of St.
James Cathedral will go dark to participate in Earth
Hour from 8:30 to 9:30pm Saturday, March 19,
bringing awareness to the issue of climate change in
the spirit of <i>Laudato Si</i>, Pope Francis’ encyclical on
environment and poverty. During Earth Hour, please
plan to join us for an hour of candlelit prayer for
creation in the cathedral. Or, if you cannot join us here
at the cathedral, wherever you are, please consider
powering down and praying for our planet during that
hour. Together we can create a better future for us and
our common home. <i>Information</i>,
