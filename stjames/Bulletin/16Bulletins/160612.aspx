<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>
<p><b>COVER ART</b> Detail of Last Supper bas-relief, Blessed
Sacrament Chapel. Artist unknown, 1907.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from the Baccalaureate
Mass of Seattle University. Congratulations, Class of
2016!</p>
<p><b>YEAR OF MERCY</b>. We welcome all pilgrims to St. James
Cathedral during this Year of Mercy. Whether you are a
visitor or a regular at St. James, you can walk through
the Holy Doors of Mercy, the four bronze doors at the
Cathedral’s west entrance. The center doors are opened
before and after each Mass. A self-guided pilgrimage of
prayer, <i>The Way of Mercy</i>, is available as well—pick up a flyer just 
inside the Holy Doors. </p>

	<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We were asked to
help a man who recently had a mental breakdown. He
had been homeless for many years. Nearly all his
possessions were still in storage and soon to be auctioned
off by the storage company for nonpayment of storage
fees. Loss of his possessions would have been more than
he could handle. We helped pay the storage fees, and a
family member arranged to move all the items to another
family member’s home for safekeeping while the man
recovers. Your financial support made this possible –
thank you! Would you like to become a “contributing
member” of SVdP at the Cathedral? <i>Information</i>,
