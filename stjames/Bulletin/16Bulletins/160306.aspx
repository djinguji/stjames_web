<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our <b>Sunday Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>
<p><b>COVER ART</b> <i>The Return of the Prodigal Son</i> by
Rembrandt, c. 1667. This beautiful painting is the
subject of Henri Nouwen’s classic Return of the
Prodigal Son, which is the subject of our Lenten smallgroup
study this Lent. Copies of the book and
reflection questions are available in the Cathedral
Bookstore.</p>
<p><b>YEAR OF MERCY</b>. We welcome all pilgrims to St. James
Cathedral during this Year of Mercy. Whether you are a
visitor or a regular at St. James, you can walk through
the Holy Doors of Mercy, the four bronze doors at the
Cathedral’s west entrance. The center doors are opened
before and after each Mass. A self-guided pilgrimage of
prayer, <i>The Way of Mercy</i>, is available as well—pick up a flyer just 
inside the Holy Doors. The banner at the ministers’
pier, by fabric artist Juanita Yoder, was commissioned
for the Year of Mercy. It suggests the overflowing streams of God’s
mercy.</p>
<p><b>THE CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES COLLECTION</b> funds
six Catholic agencies that work to serve our suffering
brothers and sisters around the world. Through
humanitarian aid, resettling displaced individuals and
families (especially now for Syrian refugees
throughout the Middle East and in Europe), and
providing legal and advocacy services for migrants, the
CRS Collection allows us to see every encounter with
a person who is suffering as an opportunity to help
Jesus in disguise.</p>
<p><b>THERE WILL BE NO COFFEE HOUR AFTER THE NOON
MASS TODAY</b>. An important Sacramental Preparation
event will take place in the Cathedral Hall from
1:00pm to 4:00pm. We apologize for the
inconvenience and thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p><b>FEED THE HUNGRY</b>. The St. James team at Operation Nightwatch is seeking an assistant cook for the 3rd
Tuesday of the month, 5:30pm-7:30pm, at 302 14th
Ave S. Also, sandwich makers are needed-positions
are for either the 1st Tuesday of the month or the 3rd
Tuesday. All of these volunteer positions requires a 6-month commitment. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>WINTER SHELTER HYGIENE NEEDS</b>. The overflow Winter Shelter is currently 
in need of spray deodorant cough drops, and disposable razors. You can drop off 
donations at Coffee Hour on Sunday mornings or at the front desk, Monday-Friday, 
9am-5pm. Thanks in advance for your generosity! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Sometimes we
visit people who call our Helpline (206-767-6449; 8am
-3pm Monday-Friday) asking for food or clothes or
some other type of assistance, but when we arrive at
their apartment, we see they have no bed to sleep on or
a bed in such bad condition that no one should have to
sleep on it. How happy it makes them when we say
that SVdP can give them a new bed. Your donations
make this possible – thank you!</p>
<p><b>PEACE - MUSIC OF THREE FAITHS</b>. Saturday, March
12 & Sunday, March 13, 2016 at 8:00 pm Seattle Pro Musica ~ Peace explores the deep connections
between three Abrahamic faiths: Judaism, Christianity,
and Islam. Anchoring the program are Gloria
(everywhere) by Turkish-American composer Kamran
Ince with words by the 13th-century Sufi poet Rumi,
and I sing of love by Bernard Hughes, who weaves
together texts from Jewish, Christian, and Muslim
traditions. The concert also features uplifting works by
Renaissance Jewish composer Salomone Rossi and
contemporary Latvian composer &#274;rik Ešenvalds, along
with Islamic and Maronite chants. <i>Information and
