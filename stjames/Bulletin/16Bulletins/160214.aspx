<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our <b>Sunday Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>
<p><b>COVER ART</b> Moses leads the Israelites through the Red
Sea. Detail of the Ceremonial Bronze Doors, Ulrich Henn, artist.</p>
<p><b>THE CATHOLIC HOME MISSIONS APPEAL</b> funds
catechesis, seminarian education, lay ministry training,
Hispanic ministry, and other pastoral programs for US
dioceses in need. As a result of your generosity, Catholic
Home Missions impacts the lives of nearly nine million
Catholics in the United States. Please give generously to
Catholic Home Missions. Your support will truly make a
difference in helping to strengthen the Church here in
the United States.</p>
<p><b>RECEPTION FOR JOHN SIMPSON</b>. Today at coffee hour,
following the 10 o’clock Mass you will have an
opportunity to greet John Simpson and to thank him for
his years of ministry here at St. James. We wish John all
the best and are profoundly grateful for his years of
ministry in our midst.</p>
<p><b>YEAR OF MERCY</b>. We welcome all pilgrims to St. James
Cathedral during this Year of Mercy. Whether you are a
visitor or a regular at St. James, you can walk through
the Holy Doors of Mercy, the four bronze doors at the
Cathedral’s west entrance. The center doors are opened
before and after each Mass. A self-guided pilgrimage of
prayer, <i>The Way of Mercy</i>, is available as well—pick up
a flyer just inside the Holy Doors. Find out more at
<a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/mercy/default.aspx">the parish website</a>. The banner at the ministers’
pier, by fabric artist Juanita Yoder, was commissioned
for the Year of Mercy. It suggests the overflowing
streams of mercy which God pours out on us, and which
we are invited to experience more deeply in the Year of
Mercy.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU LISTENING, GOD?</b> A four-week, drop-in class
for parents beginning next Sunday. Explore your
relationship with God while your children are in Faith
Formation classes. February 21 & 28, March 6 & 13,

<p><b>DIVINE MERCY: AN AFTERNOON OF REFLECTION</b>. On
Saturday, February 20, from 12:00pm – 1:30pm, you
are invited to an afternoon of reflection on the Divine
Mercy, given by the Sisters of Divine Mercy. The

Kowalska and St. John Paul II. Confessions will be
available from 11:00am until 1:30pm. The day will

volunteer for a ministry, arrange to have a Mass
offered, and discover more about this community.</p>
<p><b>PARISH OFFICE CLOSED</b>. The Parish Office will be
closed on Monday, February 15, in observance of
Presidents’ Day. The Cathedral will be open for prayer
and Masses will follow the usual daily schedule.</p>
<p><b>ARCHDIOCESAN SURVEY—LAST CHANCE TO
PARTICIPATE</b>. St. James Cathedral has been invited to
participate in a national survey on parish life and
spiritual growth. The survey, the Disciple Maker
Index, is conducted annually by the highly respected
consulting firm, the Catholic Leadership Institute. If
you have not yet done so, please take a few moments
to visit the Cathedral website and follow the 
<a href="../../Events/2016/disciplemakerindex.aspx">link to the
survey</a>, which will take about ten-fifteen minutes to
complete. <b>The survey closes on February 17, so this
will be your last chance to participate!</b> <i>Information</i>,
<a href="mailto:mlaughlin@stjames-cathedral.org?subject=Archdiocesan Survey">Maria Laughlin</a>, 206-382-4284. The survey is open

<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN</b> needs a volunteer

<p><b>ART EXHIBIT: IMPRINT OF MERCY BY TRUNG PHAM,
SJ</b>. During this Lent of the Year of Mercy, we are
pleased to welcome to the Chapel a series of paintings
by Father Trung Pham, SJ, Assistant Professor of Art
and Art History at Seattle University. These paintings
invite us to meditate on wounds—Christ’s wounds and
ours. “Pope Francis affirms that the name of God is
Mercy. The deepest way one can experience mercy
fully is to keep in touch with one’s own wounds and
the wounds of others. How do the wounds look
visually? The Imprint of Mercy series will reveal the
artworks of the wounds, help viewers to meditate upon
the meaning of mercy and experience the power of
vulnerability through the arts.” Father Pham will give
a brief talk on the series on Sunday, February 28
immediately following the 10:00am Mass.</p>
<p><b>SANDWICH MAKER NEEDED FOR NIGHTWATCH</b>. Our
team at Operation Nightwatch, a service organization
for people experiencing homelessness, needs a
sandwich maker for the first Tuesday of the month.
This volunteer would arrive at 302 14th Ave S (14th &
Main) at 5:30pm and stay until 7:00pm. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Two grandmas
take turns caring for several small grandchildren
whose parents are incarcerated. One of the grandmas
called our Helpline, saying she was tempted to steal
from the grocery store to put food on the table. We
visited and learned she had almost no cash, no food
stamps and the family had been eating “nothing but
beans this week.” We helped with food and other
necessities and encouraged her to use free meal
programs (including the Cathedral Kitchen) and food
banks nearby. Your support of SVdP makes a positive
difference in the lives of many poor residents of our
parish. Would you like to join us?
