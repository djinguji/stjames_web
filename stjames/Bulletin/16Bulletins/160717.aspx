<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I am happy to be able to share with you some good news for the future of our
parish. With the enthusiastic approval of our Parish Finance Council and of
Archbishop Sartain, we have entered, along with the Archdiocese, into a long-term
lease arrangement with a local developer for the half-block of property south of the
Cathedral on Terry Avenue between Cherry and James Streets. The parish holds title
to the major part of that property; the remainder of it belongs to the Archdiocese.</p>
<p>The parish’s portion of the property was acquired over the last twenty-five
years. The purchase price of the parcel at the corner of Terry Avenue and James Street
that houses the Solanus Casey Center was partly donated by a generous friend of the
Cathedral in 2005; the purchase of the large duplex just north of that was made
possible in part by a parishioner’s generous bequest some years ago.</p>
<p>But there has been a down side to owning these properties—the monthly
mortgage payments! The long term lease we are now negotiating will not only
eliminate the mortgage payments, but also provide an income stream well into the
future—funds that will function something like a modest endowment, helping us
bridge the budget deficit we have been carrying for many years, and providing for the
preservation of the Cathedral and the support—and perhaps even expansion—of our
many ministries.</p>
<p>One of our priorities in entering into the lease will be to find suitable alternate
locations for both the Solanus Casey Center and the Cathedral Kitchen Garden, both
of which are housed on that half-block. We have several possibilities we are actively
exploring. Happily, we have ample time to plan for these moves.</p>
<p>There will be a definite advantage to the Cathedral and to the community at
large in the use to which the property will be put. The developers are Columbia
Pacific, LLC, a local firm and a highly respected one. Their plan is to build senior
housing on the property. We are happy about this because this is a project that is
highly compatible with the Cathedral’s mission and will be a real benefit to the
neighborhood and to the parish. Construction is likely to begin in mid-2017.</p>
<p>There is one more advantage: because we are choosing to enter into a long-term
lease arrangement with the developers, rather than selling the property outright, the
Cathedral will retain ownership of the property. Decades from now, when the lease
expires, the Cathedral will be blessed to still have this asset at its disposal. Given the
shifting needs of the Church and the evolving nature of our city, I am sure you can see
the wisdom of this arrangement.</p>
<p>At moments like this I can’t but be reminded that each time we walk through
the doors of St. James Cathedral, we are the beneficiaries of the foresight and
generosity of the generations of parishioners that have gone before us. As pastor, I am
particularly aware of their legacy. It’s a legacy that is embodied in everything we do
here—our worship, our witness, our outreach—and, of course, in the beautiful
Cathedral itself and in the wonderful parish facilities that we enjoy today. We should
feel very blessed, then, at this new and promising development in the life of our
parish. Like those who have gone before us, we get to hand on our own legacy to
generations yet to come!</p>

<p><b>CELEBRATING THE APOSTLE TO THE
APOSTLES</b>. Each year on July 22, the Church honors
St. Mary Magdalene—the first witness to the
Resurrection of Christ. Pope Francis recently
announced that the Memorial of this great saint will
now be observed throughout the Church as a Feast,
raising the observance of “the apostle to the Apostles”
to the same rank as that of the male Apostles. Pope
Francis’ intent is to heighten awareness of the key role
of women in the handing on of the Christian mystery.
Next Friday, July 22, will be the first observance of the
Feast of St. Mary Magdalene, and we will celebrate
the Feast in a special way at the 5:30pm Mass with
music. Father Ryan will preside.</p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited an elderly woman who lived 
in the same Capitol Hill apartment over 20 years, loved it and wanted to stay 
there the rest of her life. Unfortunately, the building owner hired a new 
property manager who imposed large rent increases on most tenants. This poor 
woman’s monthly rent was increased 30%, making her apartment too expensive to 
keep. We could not remove the grief and anger she felt over losing her beloved 
home. But, with your help, we paid part of her rent so she could avoid eviction 
while she searched for an affordable apartment – thank you!
