<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our <b>Sunday Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>
<p><b>COVER ART</b>. The official logo of the Year of Mercy
shows Jesus carrying Adam on his shoulders. “The Good
Shepherd, in his great mercy, takes humanity upon
himself… Christ sees with the eyes of Adam, and Adam
with the eyes of Christ.”</p>
<p><b>NO COFFEE HOUR AFTER 10:00AM MASS TODAY</b>. The
Cathedral Hall will be the gathering place for the solemn
procession at the beginning of the Noon Mass. Because
of this, we are unable to offer coffee hour after 10:00am
Mass. 10:00am Mass-goers are welcome to join the
procession and witness the opening of the Doors of
Mercy. Simply come to Cathedral Hall, where the special
liturgy with Archbishop Sartain and Father Ryan will
begin at Noon.</p>
<p><b>A SERVICE OF READINGS AND CAROLS</b>. Sunday,
December 13 at 7:30 pm, Stacey Sunde directs the
Cathedral's youth choirs in the traditional candlelit
service of readings and carols. Readings are juxtaposed
with choral works and congregational singing to tell the
story of the Christ Child from the foretelling by the
prophets to the nativity. Father Ryan will preside.</p>
