<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited an
electrician who recently moved here. Before moving,
he was renting a room to a tenant who, when told he
would have to move out, got angry, shot and robbed
the man. Determined to start a new life, the electrician
took a cross-country bus before his gunshot wound
healed. After such setbacks, he needed rent assistance
while learning computer skills necessary to obtain
union employment in our competitive job market, so
he called the SVdP Helpline (206-767-6449). Your financial donations helped keep 
him housed another month–thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>BAPTISM OF INFANTS & YOUNG CHILDREN</b> (under the
age of 7) is celebrated monthly at one of the weekend
Masses. To prepare for this most important sacrament,
parents and godparents participate in a series of classes
to update their understanding of baptism, to reflect on
their responsibility to guide their children in the
practice of the faith, and to learn about the many ways
our parish supports families. Please allow at least two
months for preparation. <i>Information</i>,
