<p><b>VINCENT DE PAUL SOCIETY THANKS YOU</b>. A young
woman who came to the United States as a child spent
years saving enough money to pay naturalization fees
required to become a citizen. She had a parttime job,
supplemented with income from helping friends and
neighbors with pet care. She was about to submit her
naturalization application when her income dropped.
Suddenly she could not afford rent without using up the
money saved toward citizenship. With your support, we
provided just enough rent help so she could keep her
apartment and become an American citizen shortly
before Thanksgiving–thank you! <i>Information</i>,
