<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL WELCOMES YOU</b>. Sometimes we
visit people who have served prison sentences,
sometimes for many years and sometimes for very
serious crimes. Many have been homeless. Many have
mental illnesses or are in need of significant medical
or dental care. In them, we see the face of Jesus. Just
like us, they need food, clothing, a roof over their
heads and a bed to sleep in. Just like us, they have a
God who cares for them and who asks us to care for
them, too. They need someone kind to talk with,
maybe to share some of their troubles with – someone
who will not judge them but will offer compassion and
a few encouraging words. Would you like to walk this
walk with us? We are always looking for new
volunteers. <i>Information</i>,

<p dir="ltr"><b><i>WHEEL</i> IS A GRASSROOTS ORGANIZING EFFORT</b> of
homeless/formerly-homeless women, well-regarded in
Seattle. For the past 16 years they’ve operated a
loving, low-barrier, night-time women’s shelter, which
is currently seeking a new home. Starting August 1, St
James will allow use of Cathedral Hall for WHEEL, so
that 50-60 women, along with 2 WHEEL staff, may
have a safe and secure place to sleep. WHEEL will
only be here at night, and will not interrupt the daily
life of the Cathedral. Because of the Cathedral’s
commitment to the Winter Shelter, WHEEL is actively
pursuing a new and permanent host site and will stay
only until late September. If you are aware of a
possible new site in or very near to Downtown for
WHEEL, or if you have questions, contact Patrick Barredo, 206-382-4515.</p>
