<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James Cathedral is proud to welcome 
visitors from near and far throughout the summer months. Each week a drawing for 
a special Cathedral gift will be made from among all the visitor envelopes used. 
Please write your address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and drop 
it with your offering into the collection basket. Thank you for adding to the 
power of our prayer by your presence in our midst today</i>. <b>Last week, we had
visitors from Weston, MA; Durham, NC; Vancouver, BC; and Memphis, TN. The winner 
of our drawing was from Lima, OH. </b> </p>
<p><b>COVER ART</b>. View of the Cathedral’s North Tower from
the top of the South Tower.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in loving memory of
Bryan Henderson from his family.</p>
<p><b>ARCHBISHOP SARTAIN</b> will be undergoing spinal surgery
at a New York hospital this coming week. He will be
grateful for the support of our prayers now and during the
fairly lengthy period of convalescence.</p>
<p><b>YEAR OF MERCY</b>. We welcome all pilgrims to St. James
Cathedral during this Year of Mercy. Whether you are a
visitor or a regular at St. James, you can walk through
the Holy Doors of Mercy, the four bronze doors at the
Cathedral’s west entrance. The center doors are opened
before and after each Mass. A self-guided pilgrimage of
prayer, <i>The Way of Mercy</i>, is available as well—pick up a flyer just 
inside the Holy Doors. </p>

<p><b>CAMINO SEATTLE WALK AFTER 10AM MASS</b>. Join us for a
short history walk this morning. Starting from St. James
shortly after the 10:00am Mass, our walk will take in the
highlights of one of Seattle's oldest neighborhoods: First
Hill. We will start from our beloved Cathedral and walk
the tree-lined streets as we highlight some historic
buildings and glimpse the glory days of our First Hill
neighborhood. This 1.5 mile walk will last just under one
hour. Gather on the west steps of the Cathedral (in front of
the bronze doors) after 10 o’clock Mass. All are
welcome—even if you’re not participating in Camino
Seattle!</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE OPEN AFTER MASS</b>. Visitors
and regulars alike are invited to stop by the Cathedral
Bookstore, open following each weekend Mass thank to
our volunteers. Books, rosaries, religious items, Cathedral
souvenirs, and much more! The Bookstore is located in the
Archbishop Murphy Courtyard just south of the Cathedral.</p>

	<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Sleeping on a
dog’s bed? That’s what we discovered when we visited
a middle-aged woman living Downtown who had just
come home from a two-week hospital stay and sought
our help. She could not afford a bed, and a well-intentioned
neighbor had loaned her the “doggy
mattress” so she wouldn’t have to sleep on the floor.
With your financial support, we arranged delivery of a
new bed and a clean set of sheets to help this poor
woman recuperate – thank you! Would you like to be
an SVdP home visitor?
