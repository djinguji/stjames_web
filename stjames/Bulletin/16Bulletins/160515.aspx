<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our <b>Sunday Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

<p><b>CATHEDRAL MOTHERS GROUP</b>. Becoming a

mothers live far away from their extended families and
wise elders. Our new Cathedral Mothers Group,
facilitated by child and family counselor, Ansebe Bicof-Smit, MA, LMHCA, meets every Monday from 10:30 to Noon in the Mother
Cabrini Room of the Pastoral Outreach Center. Bring

as rent, electricity, beds, food, clothes and basic
hygiene products. That's an average of 56 home visits
