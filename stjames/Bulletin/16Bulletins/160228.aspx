<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our <b>Sunday Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>
<p><b>COVER ART</b> Detail of the Cathedral’s Tabernacle,

<p><b>YEAR OF MERCY</b>. We welcome all pilgrims to St. James
Cathedral during this Year of Mercy. Whether you are a
visitor or a regular at St. James, you can walk through
the Holy Doors of Mercy, the four bronze doors at the
Cathedral’s west entrance. The center doors are opened
before and after each Mass. A self-guided pilgrimage of
prayer, <i>The Way of Mercy</i>, is available as well—pick up a flyer just 
inside the Holy Doors. The banner at the ministers’
pier, by fabric artist Juanita Yoder, was commissioned
for the Year of Mercy. It suggests the overflowing
streams of mercy which God pours out on us, and which
we are invited to experience more deeply in the Year of
Mercy.</p>
<p><b>WANT TO GET MORE INVOLVED AT ST. JAMES?</b>
Come visit the Sunday Help Desk at Coffee Hour!
Here, you can register as a parishioner, find out how to
volunteer for a ministry, arrange to have a Mass
offered, and discover more about this community.</p>
<p><b>ART EXHIBIT: IMPRINT OF MERCY BY TRUNG PHAM,
SJ</b>. During this Lent of the Year of Mercy, we are
pleased to welcome to the Chapel a series of paintings
by Father Trung Pham, SJ, Assistant Professor of Art
and Art History at Seattle University. These paintings
invite us to meditate on wounds—Christ’s wounds and
ours. Father Pham writes: “Pope Francis affirms that
the name of God is Mercy. The deepest way one can
experience mercy fully is to keep in touch with one’s
own wounds and the wounds of others. The Imprint of
Mercy series will help viewers to meditate upon the
meaning of mercy and experience the power of
vulnerability through the arts.” <b>Father Pham will give
a brief talk on the series TODAY, Sunday,
February 28 immediately following the 10:00am
Mass</b>.</p>
<p><b>GATHERING FOR PARENTS CONTINUES</b> “Are you listening, God?” is drop-in 
class for parents. Explore your relationship with God while your children are in 
Faith Formation classes. February 28, March 6 and March 13, 11:05 – 11:40 in 
Room 411 of Cathedral Place.

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
formerly homeless man and gave him a small rent
voucher and a bit of help with groceries. Never having
asked SVdP for help before, he was so moved by our visit that he serenaded us 
with two songs: one he had written about life in low-income housing and the 
other a beautiful rendition of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” Your support made 
it possible for this grateful man to remind us all that “the dreams that you 
dare to dream” really can come true – thank you!
