<p><b>JOSEPH ADAM PERFORMS THE COMPLETE ORGAN
WORKS OF DURUFLÉ</b>. On Friday, September 16 at
7:30pm, Cathedral Organist Joseph Adam performs
the complete organ works of Maurice Duruflé. Best
remembered for his few, but exquisite choral
compositions, including the famous Requiem, Duruflé
wrote a number of equally beautiful and technically
demanding pieces for organ. Fully utilizing the vast
resources of St. James’ two pipe organs, this music is
both harmonically complex and full of melody,
inspired by the Gregorian chants which Duruflé so
loved. <i>Information and reserved seating passes</i>,
