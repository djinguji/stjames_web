<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

<b>FOR YOUR SAFETY</b>. It is important for you to know that
at each of the weekend Masses a Seattle police officer
or a private security guard is present on the Cathedral
campus.</td></tr></table>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered by Edgardo
Telmo in loving memory of his mother Irene on the 4th
anniversary of her death.</p>
<p><b>THE PARISH OFFICE WILL BE CLOSED</b> on Thursday,
November 24 and Friday, November 25, in observance
of the Thanksgiving holiday. There will be just one
Mass in the Cathedral on Thanksgiving Day, at 9:30am,
after which the Cathedral will be closed. On Friday,
November 25, the Cathedral will be open and Masses
follow the usual schedule.</p>
<p><b>THANKSGIVING CANNED FOOD DRIVE</b>. Once again,
parishioners are encouraged to bring canned food and
other non-perishable food items to this year’s
Thanksgiving Day Mass, Thursday, November 24 at
9:30am. All donated goods will be shared with St.

<p><b>REFUGEE AND IMMIGRANT CONCERNS GATHERING</b>.

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
middle-aged woman who moved to Seattle for extended
medical treatment. She found a small apartment but,
with little income, could not afford cooking utensils,
dishes, bed sheets, a blanket or even a pillow. She called
the SVdP Helpline (206-767-6449). We gave her store
vouchers and suggested that, when treatments make her
too tired to cook, she enjoy a free, hot meal at the
Cathedral Kitchen. When she spoke about a church
“back home” that she misses, we urged her to join a
local faith community and invited her to St James.
Thank you for your generous support of SVdP’s ministry of presence! <i>Information</i>,
