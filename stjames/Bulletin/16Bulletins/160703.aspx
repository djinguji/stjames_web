	<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Most people call
the SVdP Helpline (206-767-6449) because they need
monetary help to pay rent or electricity bills or to buy
food, clothes or other necessities. But often when we
visit, we learn they are very lonely. Recently, we
visited a disabled woman who was standing in her
doorway, leaning on her walker as we got off the
elevator and headed down the hallway toward her
apartment. As soon as she saw us, she called out a
hearty hello and then said in a loud voice, “I am so
happy to see you because I never have visitors!” It is
such a joy and privilege to meet these people where
they live and spend a bit of time getting to know them.
Would you like to be a home visitor?
