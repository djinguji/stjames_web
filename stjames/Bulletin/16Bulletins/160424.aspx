<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I long ago became convinced that there are no blessings in life that are not
mixed. Even the most wonderful blessings invariably involve a shadow or a sadness.
The blessing I am speaking about here is a new staff member who is joining us this
month. His name is Patrick Barredo and, come summer, he will be taking over Patty
Bowman’s responsibilities in social outreach and advocacy. Patrick is definitely a
blessing, but losing Patty creates, without doubt, a serious shadow and a sadness for
all of us.</p>
<p>During her 16 years with us, Patty Bowman has put Catholic social teaching at
the very heart of our mission here at St. James Cathedral. With more volunteers than I
could ever count, she has tirelessly worked to build up our many outreach ministries
to the poor and needy while at the same time building programs and committees to
advocate on behalf of the poor and to work for a more just social order. Patty took
what I can only call a fledgling effort in the areas of social outreach and advocacy and
created something we can all be proud of and something that Seattle’s church and
civic community are well aware of.</p>
<p>Patty has decided that it is time for her to take a break (a well-deserved one!)
before deciding what’s next for her. I fully support her decision although it’s not easy
to think of going on without her. I know that any of you who have been privileged to
get to know her and to work with her over the years will feel the same. Happily, she
will continue to be a member of the parish so there’s no need to say good-bye – only a
very big and heartfelt ‘thank you.’ And we will find an appropriate way to do that
before Patty steps down at the end of June.</p>
<p>As she prepares to leave, I feel very blessed indeed to welcome to the Cathedral
pastoral team, Patrick Barredo, who has served in a similar position for nearly 15
years at Holy Rosary Parish in West Seattle. Patrick is excited about ministering at St.
James and I’m quite sure you will share that excitement when you have the
opportunity to meet him and work with him. Without relating his entire history, I
would just mention that he is married to Christina and is the proud father of Joseph,
Alex, and Ella. Patrick did both his undergraduate and graduate studies at Notre
Dame University which, I’m sure you will agree, gives him an impeccable Catholic
pedigree! He has deep, strong and proven commitments to serving the poor and to
advocating on their behalf.</p>
<p>More to follow. For the present, I would simply ask you to join me in praying
for Patty Bowman as she prepares to transition out of her position, and to join me in
welcoming Patrick Barredo as he joins the St. James Cathedral team.</p>
