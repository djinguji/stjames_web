<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our <b>Sunday Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

<p dir="ltr"><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL SOCIETY THANKS YOU</b>. Earlier
this month, we visited a middle-aged man dealing with
two recent deaths in his family, many serious health
issues of his own and multiple bills he could not pay.
We gave the modest rent help he requested and then
handed him a grocery store gift card as “a little
Christmas present.” Surprised, he said we were going to
have him in tears, that it could have been “just a penny”
and that “there are good people in this world.” Your
support helped us touch this man’s heart – thank
you! <i>Information</i>,

Catholic faith? Are you disillusioned by what you hear
about the church? Do you desire a life filled with faith?

have been home. It’s a safe place to ask questions, and
to experience a small community of faith. Winter
session begins Monday, January 11, and continues
Mondays through March. Sessions are 7:00 – 9:00 pm
in Cathedral Place. <i>Information</i>:
