<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

at each of the weekend Masses a Seattle police officer

campus.</td></tr></table>
<p><b>ON THE COVER</b>. The logo for the Year of Mercy
summarizes what the Jubilee Year is all about. The
motto Merciful Like the Father (Luke 6:36) invites all to
follow the merciful example of the Father who does not
judge or condemn but forgives and loves. The logo is
the work of Jesuit Father Marko I. Rupnik. It represents
an image important to the early Church: the Son of God
carries the lost soul upon his shoulders. The Good
Shepherd touches humanity with transforming love.
While the Good Shepherd, in his great mercy, takes
humanity upon himself, his eyes are merged with those
of the human being: Christ sees with the eyes of Adam,
and Adam with the eyes of Christ. We discover our own
humanity in Christ, and learn to contemplate, in his
gaze, the merciful love of the Father.</p>

<p>This is a letter I sent this past week to some parishioners I haven’t seen in a long time. It
strikes me that you might be aware of people like that, too. Maybe they are in your family,
or maybe they are friends, neighbors, or acquaintances. If so, I’d invite you to share the
letter below with them. What better way to end this Year of Mercy?</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>On November 20, the Jubilee Year of Mercy comes to an end. It has
been a wonderful gift to the Church from Pope Francis, who never tires of
speaking about the mercy of God. He reminds us that Mercy is God’s name.
And he reminds us, too, that God’s arms are always open and that the
embrace of God is wide beyond our imagining.</p>
<p>If you have drifted away from participating in Sunday Mass, I hope
you will consider returning. I encourage you to seek out a parish home that
nourishes you spiritually, whether here at St. James Cathedral or in your
local neighborhood.</p>
<p>If there is something that the Church has done to hurt or scandalize
you, I want to beg forgiveness in the name of the Church. And if there is
anything that we as the parish community of St. James Cathedral can do to
help you at this moment along your journey of life and faith, we very much
want to do it.</p>
<p>You are part of the great family of the Church, you are important, and
God always welcomes you with open arms. So does your Church!</p>
<p>May the amazingly good news of God’s boundless mercy touch your
heart and bring you joy and hope.</p>
