		<p>St. James Cathedral, along with the other seventeen
parishes in our South Seattle Deanery, has been
working for the last year on a plan to address the
current and future shortage of priests in the
Archdiocese as well as such issues as lay
leadership, parish collaborations, and the future of
the faith communities in the central and south areas
of the City.</p>
<p>As part of this planning process, our parish
participated in the Disciple Maker Index survey in
January as well as three Deanery wide convocations
and several Focus Groups.</p>
<p>On Sunday, October 23, we will be holding
listening sessions after all three morning masses to
share with you the plan which the Deanery
leadership is submitting to Archbishop Sartain in
December. This is a chance to give your feedback
on the draft plan before it is submitted to the
Archbishop.</p>
