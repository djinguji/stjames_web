<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>
<p><b>COVER ART</b> Christ carries his cross. East Apse stained-glass
window, St. James Cathedral. Charles Connick,
artist.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from Jeff and Melissa
Williams to commemorate their 25th Wedding
Anniversary. Flowers are also from the Saturday
wedding of Emilie Ross and Mark Gilcreest.</p>
<p><b>GUEST CHOIR SUNDAY 5:30PM</b> Spectrum Choral
Academy Youth Chorus, Stephanie Charbonneau, artistic
director.</p>
<p><b>DAILY MASS THIS WEEK</b>. During the coming week, the
priests of the Archdiocese will have their annual
gathering at Ocean Shores. Because of the limited
availability of priests during this time, there will be some
changes to our regular Mass schedule. The 8:15am Mass
will take place daily as usual. However, there will be no
5:30pm Mass on Monday, Tuesday, or Friday next week.
Instead, we will offer the Liturgy of the Hours at these
times. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p><b>YEAR OF MERCY</b>. We welcome all pilgrims to St. James
Cathedral during this Year of Mercy. Whether you are a
visitor or a regular at St. James, you can walk through
the Holy Doors of Mercy, the four bronze doors at the
Cathedral’s west entrance. The center doors are opened
before and after each Mass. A self-guided pilgrimage of
prayer, <i>The Way of Mercy</i>, is available as well—pick up a flyer just 
inside the Holy Doors. </p>

<p><b>NEW! A VISUAL ARTS DAY CAMP FOR YOUTH
ENTERING GRADES 7 THROUGH 12</b>. As a participant in
the Art of Faith camp you will: learn about the history,
science and making of stained glass; study the stained
glass of the Cathedral; visit several stained glass
installations; and make your own small stained glass
piece. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>YOUTH MUSIC CHOIR CAMP – AUGUST 8-14</b>. St. James
Cathedral presents its annual youth music choir camp
where children—ages 6-14—have opportunities to sing,
laugh, and play in a beautiful and welcoming
environment. Each day, choristers will learn beautiful
music both modern and ancient, enter into prayerful
reflection in the service of morning praise, and share
fellowship with fellow students in a variety of activities.

parish and find ways to meet fellow parishioners and

<p dir="ltr"><b>VOLUNTEERS NEEDED</b>. The Cathedral Kitchen needs a few more 
substitute gleaners to help when our other gleaners are away. Gleaners go out in 
the morning, once a week, usually as partners, to four local supermarkets and 
collect food (fruits, vegetables, milk, deli items, etc.) These items may be 
used for our daily meals or passed on to St. Mary’s Food Bank. It’s a fun and 
rewarding outreach! <i>Information</i>,
