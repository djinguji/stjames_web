<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I wish I were here to join you in welcoming our
guest homilist for the weekend. He is Father
Raymond J. Finch, MM, the Superior General
of Maryknoll. To say that it is an honor to
welcome him is an understatement. For forty
years, Father Finch has served as a missionary
in various capacities in Latin America,
especially in Peru. He has held various
leadership positions within the society and is
currently serving his second term as Superior
General. I know you will welcome him and
respond generously to his appeal on behalf of
Maryknoll.</p>

Masses, you’re invited to a group pilgrimage through
the doors followed by the Way of Mercy, a short
pilgrimage of prayer through the Cathedral which has

in the Cathedral’s west vestibule following Mass.</p>

PASTORAL PLANNING PROJECT</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy" size="5">Parish-Wide Listening Sessions</font></p>
		<p>St. James Cathedral, along with the other seventeen
parishes in our South Seattle Deanery, has been
working for the last year on a plan to address the
current and future shortage of priests in the
Archdiocese as well as such issues as lay
leadership, parish collaborations, and the future of
the faith communities in the central and south areas
of the City.</p>
<p>As part of this planning process, our parish
participated in the Disciple Maker Index survey in
January as well as three Deanery wide
convocations and several Focus Groups.
On Sunday, October 23, we will be holding
listening sessions after all three morning masses to
share with you the plan which the Deanery
leadership is submitting to Archbishop Sartain in
December. This is a chance to give your feedback
on the draft plan before it is submitted to the
Archbishop.</p>
		<p>Please join us in the Rectory Parlors after the 8:00,
10:00 and 12:00 masses on Sunday, October 23.</p>

<p><b>SUNDAY HOSPITALITY VOLUNTEERS NEEDED</b>. St.
James hosts a Coffee Hour in the Cathedral Hall on
Sundays after the 8am, 10am, and 12pm Masses. It is a
welcoming space in which persons experiencing
homelessness and parishioners can come together to
drink coffee, eat muffins, relax, and socialize. It is also
a great place to learn about the array of ministries and
volunteer opportunities at St. James. We are especially
in need of volunteers to serve coffee and muffins and
help clean up from 1pm-2pm after the Noon Mass.
