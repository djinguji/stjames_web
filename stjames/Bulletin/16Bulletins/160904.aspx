		<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL INVITES YOU</b> to consider
becoming a Vincentian! SVdP was started in 1830s
Paris when university student Frederic Ozanam (1813-53) and a few of his young 
		adult friends decided to “do” something about poverty rather than just 
		talk about it. Like Vincentians today, they went in pairs to visit the 
		poor in their homes, offering material aid and spiritual comfort. On 
		Tuesday, September 9, we celebrate the feast day of Blessed Frederic, 
		who taught us that the poor are “the sacred images of that God who we do 
		not see.” To learn more, please visit us at the September 11 Ministries
