<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
disabled woman who simply needed a new pair of
sneakers and nothing more. Suffering from chronic
back problems, she walks a lot to stay in the best
health possible. Her shoes had worn out, but she could
not afford to buy a new pair. With your financial
support, we gave her a store voucher that she could
exchange for a new pair of sneakers. Thank you for
helping this woman take good care of herself! Every
dollar you give SVdP in the special collection at the end of mass on the third 
weekend of the month makes life better for someone in our parish. <i>Information</i>,
