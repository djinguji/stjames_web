<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>FIND OUT MORE ABOUT BECOMING CATHOLIC</b>. Are
you, a family member, or a friend interested in learning
more about the Catholic Church? Come and See!
You’re invited to a no-strings-attached gathering to ask
questions and find out more on Wednesday, March 4th,
at 7:00pm in the Fireside Room (lower level of the
Pastoral Outreach Center at 907 Columbia Street).
Please use the courtyard entrance to access the Fireside
Room. All are welcome, no RSVP needed.</p>
<p><b>CENSUS 2020 – BE COUNTED!</b> It’s about Federal
Funding: The distribution of more than $675 Billion in
federal funds, grants and support to states, counties and
communities are based on census data. That money is
spent on schools, hospitals, roads, public works and
other vital programs. Be counted and make sure your
community benefits from your tax dollars. “The
Catholic Church and other service providers rely on the
national Census to provide an accurate count in order
to effectively serve those in need,” said Bishop Dewane of the USCCB. Look for your invitation to
respond to the census on or between March 12 and 20.
New this year is an online form. Your invitation
postcard will have the code you need to fill out the
form. Please consider helping others complete the
Census during Sunday Coffee Hour or at the Cathedral
Kitchen. Especially needed are bilingual speakers of
any language! <i>Information</i>,
