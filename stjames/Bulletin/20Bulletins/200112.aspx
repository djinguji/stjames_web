	<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
middle-aged woman who used to have a good job and
ample earned income while living in a nice home in
one of Seattle’s best neighborhoods. Then a fire
destroyed her home, and she lost almost all her
possessions. Traumatized by the fire, she soon
developed mental issues. Although she was granted a
modest disability income, she wound up homeless for
over a year before finding a tiny apartment where the
rent eats up most of her income. Unfortunately, she
was still paying off an old student loan. The lender
threatened to garnish her disability benefits. At her
request, we paid enough on her rent to keep a roof over
her head while she worked with an attorney to resolve
the threatened garnishment. So many people in our
parish are going through hard times, and your support
to SVdP helps so much – thank you!

<p><b>GRIEF SUPPORT GROUP</b>. Are you grieving the death
of someone close to you? Grief and loss can have a
significant impact on our lives long after the death of
the person we love. The grieving process has no
timeline and is unique to each individual, but meeting
with others who are going through a similar experience
can provide support and help us cope. You are invited
to join this 8-week grief support group facilitated by
St. James Cathedral staff. Wednesdays, January 22
through March 11, 6:30pm-8:00pm in the Gallagher
Center. <i>Information and registration</i>,
