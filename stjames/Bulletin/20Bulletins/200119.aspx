	<p dir="ltr"><b>JANUARY IS POVERTY AWARENESS MONTH</b>.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. fought tirelessly to
eliminate injustice and segregation from the minds and
hearts of the American people. He understood that
eliminating poverty is not about a hand-out; it is
restoring the respect that all persons deserve. Read
more from Dr. King’s 1967 speech “Where Do We Go
From Here?”. Challenge: Learn about—and join—Catholics in the work to address the sin of racism and
end racial injustice in our communities (<a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/racism/index.cfm">http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/racism/index.cfm</a>).</p>
<p><b>ANOINTING OF THE SICK</b>. On Saturday, February 15 at
10:30am, Father Ryan will celebrate a special Mass
with the Anointing of the Sick. Those who struggle
with chronic illness, who are facing surgery, or who
deal with the weakness that comes with age are
especially encouraged to participate.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b> for your donations
