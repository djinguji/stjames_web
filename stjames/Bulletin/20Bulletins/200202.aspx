	<p><b>SCHOLARSHIPS AVAILABLE FOR CATHOLIC
SCHOOLS</b>. St. James has SIX Catholic Elementary
Schools in Seattle: St. Therese, St. Paul, St. Edward,
St. George, St. Joseph and Holy Family Bilingual.
These schools provide in-parish tuition rates for
registered St. James parishioners. We also support
FOUR Catholic High Schools (O’Dea, Holy Names,
Bishop Blanchet, and Kennedy Catholic) through the Simperman Scholar program. Please contact 
<a href="mailto:tvandeven@stjames-cathedral.org?subject=Scholarships for Catholic Schools">Theresa
Van de Ven</a> at 206-219-5822 for requirements and an application
packet for the 2020-2021 school year. Completed
applications must be submitted by April 30, 2020.</p>
<p><b>CARE FOR CREATION TIP</b>. Here’s a simple way to
reduce your carbon footprint: switch to e-billing. In the
U.S., paper products make up the largest percentage of

paper by signing up for e-billing.</p>
