<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS ALL OUR DONORS</b> for
your great generosity as 2019 comes to a close. Our SVdP conference at St James 
Cathedral is run entirely by volunteers. We have no paid staff. In our last 
fiscal year, we had only about 20 volunteers at any given time. Those volunteers 
gladly gave 3,316 hours of service to put your funds to good use helping 
residents of our parish who struggle financially. Over 99% of the money we spent 
went directly to help the poor. Our biggest expenditures were for rent (74% of 
total expense) and beds (12%), with the remainder spent mostly on food, 
utilities, household items, furniture, security deposits and clothes. Combining 
your treasure, our time and the prayers of all, we make quite a team–thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>A GLIMPSE INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH & WELLNESS
MINISTRY</b>. A message from Martha: “ I volunteer at the 10:00 Mass. My goal is 
to welcome people experiencing mental health problems or homelessness while 
keeping St James a safe place for all parishioners. Twenty-eight years as a 
Mental Health Specialist at Harborview have given me plenty of practice. A 
recent example of my role was when a preoccupied woman carrying all her 
belongings rushed toward the altar while Father Ryan was saying Mass. I quickly 
offered to find her a seat. The parishioners in my pew made room and we sat 
together for the rest of the Mass. Thanks to all of you for helping make St. 
James a welcoming place”. In addition to serving as an Emmaus Companion at 
Sunday mass, Martha also provides ministry of presence during the Coffee Hour. 
If you are interested in meeting Martha to learn more about what she does, or to 
explore how you might be able to participate in this important and rewarding 
ministry, contact

<p><b>WHAT IS THE MINDFUL ALTERNATIVE GROUP?</b>
Mindful Alternative Support Group has been offered at
St. James since 2014. This group is specifically
designed for parents and caregivers of adult children
with serious mental illness. It provides an opportunity
to share experiences related to the challenges of loving
someone who lives with a brain disorder. Members
discuss important issues related to treatment, housing,
education, employment and how their loved one will
manage their daily lives. The group helps loved ones
explore thoughtful alternatives to current difficult
situations. Facilitator, Terry Proctor is the dad of an
adult son who lives with schizophrenia and has been
facilitating groups like these for many years. The group
is held on the last Saturday of the month at 3:00pm.

<p><b>PANHANDLING: A DISCIPLESHIP RESPONSE</b>. At St.
James Cathedral, we take very seriously our call to
help our brothers and sisters in need. Your ongoing
commitment and generosity makes possible a wide
variety of outreach services at the Cathedral, including
a very active St. Vincent de Paul conference, the
Winter Shelter, and the Cathedral Kitchen, to name a
few. However, for the safety of all our parishioners and
visitors, especially the elderly, S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">t.
</span>J<span style="font-variant: small-caps">ames </span>C<span style="font-variant: small-caps">athedral 
does not permit panhandling on the </span>C<span style="font-variant: small-caps">athedral grounds</span>. (This includes the O’Dea High School
property.) Unfortunately, cash given on the street often
goes to support addictions. Giving money directly to
individuals may allow them to survive on the streets,
for a short time, but professional case management
truly serves their long-term care. We believe it is much
more effective to provide direct services, or to refer
people to other programs and services designed to
address their needs. We ask that you help support this
Cathedral policy by not giving cash to panhandlers in
or around the Cathedral. <i>Information</i>,
