<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
young man who, when even younger, spent five years
in prison. He told us he was trying to learn to be a
responsible adult, to “do normal things and stay out of
bad situations.” That can be hard to do with less than
$500 monthly income, recurring bouts of depression
and a history of trouble. He was able to pay his rent but
needed our help to pay his water/sewer/garbage bill.
His landlord was threatening eviction if he did not
catch up with utilities payments. With your help, we
paid just enough on those utilities to avoid further
trouble and keep him safely housed - thank you!
