<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>RESPONDING TO THE THREAT OF THE CORONAVIRUS</b>.
In response to the outbreak of Coronavirus in King
County, Archbishop Etienne has asked all Catholics in
the Archdiocese to observe the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you are sick or feel you are getting sick, stay at
home and do NOT attend Mass. Missing Mass due
to illness is not sinful; it is prudent and shows care
for your brothers and sisters.</li>
	<li>During Mass, at the Sign of Peace, simply say,
“Peace be with you,” instead of offering your hand.</li>
	<li>During Communion, the Eucharist will only be
offered in the hand, not on the tongue. Additionally,
we will refrain from offering the Precious Blood
from the chalice at this time.</li>
	<li>You will notice that we have drained the holy water
in the church, until further notice. Please simply
bless yourself with the sign of the cross as you enter
and exit the church.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>JOURNEY OF THE ELECT</b>. Lent is a time of intensive
prayer and preparation for our Elect. This final period
of purification and enlightenment, which, since the
beginnings of the Church, is intended to purify the
hearts and minds of the Elect as they search their own
consciences and do penance. This period is also
intended to enlighten their minds and hearts with a
deeper knowledge of Christ the Savior. Please pray for
those to be baptized at the Easter Vigil: Alex Bratt &#9642;
Lisa Finch &#9642; Christine Flogel &#9642; Brian Igleheart &#9642; Marcos
Olazabal &#9642; Linda Ta &#9642; Obed Torres &#9642; Allie Vincent &#9642;
And for our youth elect: Samuel Sproule &#9642; Brielle Oh &#9642;
Joella Oh. Visit the Cathedral website to watch a short
video introducing our Elect to you. Please pray for our
Elect each day during this season of Lent. As Easter
draws near, you will be invited to write a note telling
our Elect of your prayerful support.</p>

20th-century French artist Georges Rouault.</p>

and address it to: Jose Alberto Robles- Martínez –

<p><b>CARE FOR CREATION TIP</b>. From <i>The New York Times</i>.
In the past month, there has been a remarkable drop in
CO2 emissions, the main driver of global warming.
The coronavirus outbreak in China, which has sickened
at least 80,000 people, has shut down factories,
refineries and flights. China’s carbon dioxide
emissions over the past 3 weeks have been about 25%
lower than the same period last year, according to
Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at the Center for Research
on Energy and Clean Air. The numbers offer a
sobering reminder of how deeply the modern economy
still depends on fossil fuels. Whenever industrial
activity declines, climate pollution tends to plummet,
too.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL ASKS</b> you to please take time
during Lent to select and set aside a few treasures you
can part with at our annual “Stuff the Truck” event on
Sunday, March 15 in the O’Dea parking lot, from
7:30am to 1:30pm. Big sellers in our thrift stores
include clothes, books, DVDs, dishes, pots, pans and
other kitchen items. Money raised from SVdP store
sales supports SVdP efforts to help low income
residents throughout King County. For more details,
see Stuff the Truck flyer posted on St James website.
Thank you! <i>Information</i>, Ken Goddard, 206-981-7185.</p>
