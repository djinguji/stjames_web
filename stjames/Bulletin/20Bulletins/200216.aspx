	<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited an
elderly woman whose agoraphobia causes her to suffer
severe panic attacks when outside her home. Her
governmental benefits pay for weekly “caregiver
hours,” but those hours are almost entirely consumed
traveling to and from and sitting with the caregiver in
doctors’ offices. The little time left each week is used
by the caregiver to take her to the grocery store. Plus,
she is estranged from her family, who she thinks
believes she is “crazy.” She asked us for rent help,
which we gave. We prayed that the time we spent
talking with and listening to her was at least as
valuable as our rent voucher. Your support makes
visits like this possible – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>CARE FOR CREATION TIP</b>. This year marks the 50th
anniversary of Earth Day. To celebrate, St. James
Cathedral has joined many faith communities, nonprofits,
sports team and businesses to honor Earth
Day’s legacy, and to celebrate the next five decades by
asking all people to take action for the environment
and our communities. To learn more, visit

<p><b>CENSUS 2020 – BE COUNTED!</b> It’s about Federal
Funding: The distribution of more than $675 Billion in
federal funds, grants and support to states, counties and
communities are based on census data. That money is
spent on schools, hospitals, roads, public works and
other vital programs. Be counted and make sure your
community benefits from your tax dollars. “The
Catholic Church and other service providers rely on the
national Census to provide an accurate count in order
to effectively serve those in need,” said Bishop Dewane of the USCCB. Look for your invitation to
respond to the census on or between March 12 and 20.
New this year is an online form. Your invitation
postcard will have the code you need to fill out the
form. Please consider helping others complete the
Census during Sunday Coffee Hour or at the Cathedral
Kitchen. Especially needed are bilingual speakers of
any language! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>FUNERAL RECEPTION VOLUNTEERS</b>. If you have
ever lost a loved one (and who hasn’t?) you
know how important it was to have friends and
neighbors reach out when you were in the raw
stages of grief. Our Funeral Reception
Committee does just that! After a funeral Mass,
St. James volunteers welcome and serve
bereaved families and friends as they gather to
tell stories and comfort one another. With the
recent retirement of several long-time volunteers,
we need additional help. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>MINISTRY OF PRESENCE IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>.
Each weekday in the Cathedral, a volunteer sits
at a desk in the northeast corner of the Cathedral
near the Mary Shrine, available to answer
questions, accept prayer requests, and greet
visitors who stop in between 1:00pm-4:00pm.
It’s a quiet time to pray, read, and be present to
those who come to the Cathedral, often people in
need. <b>We are currently looking for volunteers
who might cover one weekday afternoon each
month, beginning in March or April</b>. If you’d
some quiet time in the Cathedral, we’d love to
have you be a part of this ministry. <i>Information</i>,
