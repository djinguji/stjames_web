<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

12:30pm-6:30pm (closed 2:30–3:30pm). What better

donating blood during the holy season of Advent.
Blood donors have a profound life-giving impact on
our entire community, including those with acute needs
due to injury and accident, those who require
transfusions to combat the effects of chemotherapy,
those who live with chronic illnesses and need blood
transfusions to survive, those undergoing organ
transplants. Each blood donation can help up to 3 lives.
How many lives will you save? Sign up at Coffee
Hours on 12/1 and 12/8 or schedule an appointment
online at <a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.bloodworks.org/drives">www.bloodworks.org/drives</a>.</p>

<p><b>PANHANDLING: A DISCIPLESHIP RESPONSE</b>. At St.
James Cathedral, we take very seriously our call to
help our brothers and sisters in need. Your ongoing
commitment and generosity makes possible a wide
variety of outreach services at the Cathedral, including
a very active St. Vincent de Paul conference, the
Winter Shelter, and the Cathedral Kitchen, to name a
few. However, for the safety of all our parishioners and
visitors, especially the elderly, S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">t.
</span>J<span style="font-variant: small-caps">ames </span>C<span style="font-variant: small-caps">athedral 
does not permit panhandling on the </span>C<span style="font-variant: small-caps">athedral grounds</span>. (This includes the O’Dea High School
property.) Unfortunately, cash given on the street often
goes to support addictions. Giving money directly to
individuals may allow them to survive on the streets,
for a short time, but professional case management
truly serves their long-term care. We believe it is much
more effective to provide direct services, or to refer
people to other programs and services designed to
address their needs. We ask that you help support this
Cathedral policy by not giving cash to panhandlers in
or around the Cathedral. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>CARE FOR CREATION TIP</b>. The beginning of Advent is a great time to 
start looking at a change of habits. Today, reflect on one habit you have that 
might not be so environmentally conscious, and how you can change it. For 
example, time your shower for 5 minutes or less, or turn off the water while 
soaping up. Want suggestions on caring for creation throughout the Advent 
season? Download our

<p><b>CONSIDER JOINING THE WINTER SHELTER TEAM!</b> We
have openings for overnight volunteers for Sunday
nights, and breakfast hosts for Sundays, Mondays and
Tuesdays. We also need volunteers who can substitute
in case our regular volunteers are unavailable.
If you cannot be an overnight host or provide
breakfast, you can support the Winter Shelter by
donating: spray deodorant, large tubes of toothpaste,
cough drops, hand warmers, Travel-size Tissues and
Lip Balm. Items can be brought to Coffee Hour, or
dropped off or mailed to the Parish Office. Thank you!

<p><b>PARENTAL NOTIFICATION INITIATIVE</b>. Washington is
one of only six states in the country that do not require
any parental involvement before a minor can have an
abortion. To change this policy, the bishops of
Washington State support an initiative to the
legislature. I-1004 would require physicians to notify a
parent or guardian before performing an abortion on a
minor. The initiative does not require parental
permission, only parental notification. I-1004 contains
reasonable exceptions to protect minors in cases where
notification may threaten the minor’s safety or where a
valid medical exemption is present. Failure to comply
with the law would carry criminal penalties and
provide grounds for civil claims. January 4, 2020 is the
deadline for submission of 320,000 signatures of
registered voters to the office of the Secretary of State.
Petitions will be available to sign through December 1
at the Sunday morning coffee hours and in the west
vestibule of the cathedral after 5:30 Masses. More
information about this initiative can be found at
<a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.parentsandstudentsprotectingminors.org">www.parentsandstudentsprotectingminors.org</a>.</p>


<p><b>ROSARY</b>. All are welcome to join with a group of
parishioners who pray the rosary together in the
Chapel, Monday through Saturday at 7:40am.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we pray for the parishes of St. Nicholas in Gig Harbor,
Immaculate Conception in Arlington and Mount Vernon, and
Immaculate Conception Mission in Steilacoom.</p>
