<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the

from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

transfusions to survive, those undergoing organ

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
middle-aged man whose back was broken in a jobrelated
accident. While recovering, he was diagnosed
with a respiratory problem that requires regular use of
an oxygen supply. Making matters worse, he was
having sleep problems because he did not have a bed.
A friend offered an air mattress, but the injured man
could not get up off the floor. Instead, he spent nights
painfully trying to sleep upright in a chair. Your
donations to SVdP at the Cathedral paid for a new bed,
helping this man get the rest he badly needs - thank
you! <i>Information</i>,
