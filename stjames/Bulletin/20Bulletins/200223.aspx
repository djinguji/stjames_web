	<p><b>MINISTRY OF PRESENCE IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>.
Each weekday in the Cathedral, a volunteer sits
at a desk in the northeast corner of the Cathedral
near the Mary Shrine, available to answer
questions, accept prayer requests, and greet
visitors who stop in between 1:00pm-4:00pm.
It’s a quiet time to pray, read, and be present to
those who come to the Cathedral, often people in
need. <b>We are currently looking for volunteers
who might cover one weekday afternoon each
month, beginning in March or April</b>. If you’d
some quiet time in the Cathedral, we’d love to
have you be a part of this ministry. Parking is provided. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>CENSUS 2020 – BE COUNTED!</b> It’s about Federal
Funding: The distribution of more than $675 Billion in
federal funds, grants and support to states, counties and
communities are based on census data. That money is
spent on schools, hospitals, roads, public works and
other vital programs. Be counted and make sure your
community benefits from your tax dollars. “The
Catholic Church and other service providers rely on the
national Census to provide an accurate count in order
to effectively serve those in need,” said Bishop Dewane of the USCCB. Look for your invitation to
respond to the census on or between March 12 and 20.
New this year is an online form. Your invitation
postcard will have the code you need to fill out the
form. Please consider helping others complete the
Census during Sunday Coffee Hour or at the Cathedral
Kitchen. Especially needed are bilingual speakers of
any language! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we pray for the parish of St. Peter in Seattle and St.
Peter Mission in Deming, Suquamish, and Tenino.</p>
