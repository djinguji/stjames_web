	<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO</b>. This month, all proceeds
benefit our Mental Health and Wellness Ministry. The
espresso cart is open at coffee hour after 10:00am Mass.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Two cousins sharing an apartment asked 
for help. One of their mothers had been in a near-fatal accident and spent at 
least a month in the hospital. After she was sent home, her son missed several 
weeks of work while staying with and caring for her. As a result, the cousins 
were short on rent. When we visited, we wrote a voucher for rent. Then, as we 
continued to talk, we learned that both cousins work in a homeless shelter. 
Encouraged by strong faith, they “try to bring hope” to those they meet on the 
streets and in the shelter. Your support makes our help possible - thank you!
