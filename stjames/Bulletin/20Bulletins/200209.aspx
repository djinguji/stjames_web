<p><b>AGE 7 THEN GRADE 7; FIRST COMMUNION THEN

youth to prepare for Confirmation, as well – in addition to youth entering Grade 
7 or who will be age 13. St James will also continue to offer the two-year 
preparation program for children who will be age 7 when they celebrate First 
Communion. Both the Confirmation and the First Communion programs begin 
September 13, 2020. <i>Information</i>,
