<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL SHARES</b> with you an actual
message of thanks received from a young man living
downtown. He was struggling to pay rent. We helped
with just enough to save his apartment. The next day
he called the SVdP Helpline (206-767-6449), and we
were told: “He just wanted to say thank you to the
volunteers who came out and helped his family pay
their rent this month. He is so very grateful for your
assistance. He didn’t know what he was going to do
and had no idea how he was going to make the
payment on his own. He wants to thank them for being
so caring and wants them to know he really appreciates
everything they do. He also wants them to know he’d
like to give back by helping others as well. Again he
says thank you, and he hopes you have a blessed day.”
Your donations to our SVdP conference at St James and your prayers for our 
ministry make visits like this possible—thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>WHAT IS THE MINDFUL ALTERNATIVE GROUP?</b>
Mindful Alternative Support Group has been offered at
St. James since 2014. This group is specifically
designed for parents and caregivers of adult children
with serious mental illness. It provides an opportunity
to share experiences related to the challenges of loving
someone who lives with a brain disorder. Members
discuss important issues related to treatment, housing,
education, employment and how their loved one will
manage their daily lives. The group helps loved ones
explore thoughtful alternatives to current difficult
situations. Facilitator, Terry Proctor is the dad of an
adult son who lives with schizophrenia and has been
facilitating groups like these for many years. The group
is held on the last Saturday of the month at 3:00pm.
