world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

donkeys, bullfrogs, and a puppy. <i>Information and

<p><b>ARCHDIOCESAN RED MASS</b> will be celebrated by
Archbishop Sartain on Saturday, October 6 at 10:00am
in the Cathedral. The “Red Mass” for all who work in
the legal profession is a tradition going back to the 13th
century. Called the “Red Mass” because of the color of
the vestments worn, this is a time to pray that the Holy
Spirit will inspire all lawyers, judges, government
officials, law school professors, and the entire legal
community to seek truth and justice with integrity. All
are welcome.</p>
<p><b>PROTECTING GOD’S CHILDREN – SAFE
ENVIRONMENT TRAINING FOR NEW VOLUNTEERS</b>. Do

<p><b>SUPPORTING MARRIAGES</b>. Did you know the Catholic
Church really cares about your marriage and wants it
to succeed? And did you know that St. James
Cathedral parish is committed to helping married
couples live out their vocation? Good marriages can
always be made better! Pope Francis described
marriage as “a project to be worked on together” and a
“process of growth” (<i>Amoris Laetitia</i>, no. 218, 221).
We know that a good number of our couples are
without the support of extended family because they
are ‘transplants’ to the Seattle area. All the more
reason for our parish to offer opportunities to connect
with others who are in the same boat and to build
community in the process!</p>

<p><b>OUR MARRIAGE ENRICHMENT DINNERS</b> continue
Saturday, October 6 from 6:30 to 8:30pm in the
Pastoral Outreach Center. Married couples of any age
are welcome. Babysitting will be provided in the
Mother Cabrini Room. RSVP is required. <i>Information

<p><b>FUNERAL RECEPTION VOLUNTEERS</b>. If you have
ever lost a loved one (and who hasn’t?) you

consolation when you were in the raw stages of
grief. Our Funeral Reception Committee does
just that! After a funeral Mass, St. James
volunteers welcome and serve bereaved families
and friends as they gather to tell stories and
comfort one another. With the recent retirement

<p><b>MULTICULTURAL CELEBRATION OF ALL OUR SAINTS</b>.
On Saturday, November 3 at 11:00am, Archbishop Sartain will celebrate Mass with communities from
across the Archdiocese of Seattle, as we honor our
diversity and the saints who guide us along the way.
The Mass will be preceded by Exposition of the
Blessed Sacrament at 10:00am, and a reception will
follow. All are welcome!</p>
<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Access to safe drinkable water is a basic and universal
human right, since it is essential to human survival and,
as such, is a condition for the exercise of other human
rights. Our world has a grave social debt towards the
poor who lack access to drinking water, because they
are denied the right to a life consistent with their
inalienable dignity. (Pope Francis, <i>Laudato Si</i>’, 30.)
</p>
<p><b>ROSARY</b>. All are welcome to join with a group of
parishioners who pray the rosary together in the
Chapel, Monday through Saturday at 7:40am.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN BECOMING CATHOLIC?</b> If
you are an adult who has never been baptized, an adult
who has been baptized in another Christian tradition or
a Catholic who has been baptized, but not received
First Eucharist or Confirmation, you are invited to
participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the
Catholic Church. You can learn more by going to the
<a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/rcia/default.aspx">RCIA website</a>. <i>Information</i>,

age of 7) is celebrated monthly at one of the weekend
Masses. To prepare for this most important sacrament,

their responsibility to guide their children in the
practice of the faith, and to learn about the many ways
our parish supports families. Please allow at least two
months for preparation. <i>Information</i>,
