Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b> for your donations
to the special collection taken for SVdP on the third
Sunday of the month. Without your support, we could
not provide material aid to residents of St James parish
who call the SVdP Helpline (206-767-6449). For many
of you, it is truly a sacrifice to drop a dollar or more in
the SVdP collection basket or to donate to SVdP online at the Cathedral website. 
We know it is important to you to help our neighbors in need, whose deep 
gratitude we accept on your behalf during every home visit we make. In the past 
12 months, your donations took us on nearly 650 visits in our parish, funding 
our aid to more than 900 people – thank you! <i>Information</i>,
