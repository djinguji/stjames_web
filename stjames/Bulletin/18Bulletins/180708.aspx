<p align="left"><b>AN UPDATE FROM A PREPARES VOLUNTEER</b> “I
have been meeting with Cynthia, my PREPARES
client, for several months. We meet most weeks for
a couple of hours. Recently my husband and I
invited Cynthia, her husband and their 15-month
old child over to our home for a barbecue. A few
weeks later, when Cynthia’s husband had surgery,
I spent time with her at the hospital. Since Cynthia
has no family support, she tells me our relationship
really helps to keep her going and increases her
confidence as a wife and parent. I’m gratified to
have been able to provide her some emotional
support and guidance.” Please consider joining St.
James Cathedral’s PREPARES ministry by
becoming a companion to a pregnant woman or
young family in need. <i>Information</i>,
