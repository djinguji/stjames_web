<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
middle-aged, disabled man who had just moved into a
small apartment after being homeless for years, staying
in shelters and a car. Happy to finally have a place of his
own, he applied for federal disability benefits. Good
news is he quickly learned he had been approved for
such benefits years before! Bad news is the federal
government did not send him disability payments during
all the years he was homeless because they did not
know where to find him. We were happy to help with
food and an SVdP store voucher to buy household items
as he owned almost nothing other than a bed given to
him by a friend. Your support helps people rebuild their
lives – thank you. <i>Information</i>,
