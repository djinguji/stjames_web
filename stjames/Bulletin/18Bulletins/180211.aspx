<p><b>OPUS 7 VOCAL ENSEMBLE CONCERT: THE ROAD OF
MERCY</b>. On Saturday, February 17 at 8:00pm, Opus 7,
under the direction of conductor Loren Pontén ,
presents a program of choral music for the Lenten
season, which includes Benjamin Britten’s great
masterpiece, <i>Cantata Misericordium</i> for choir,
soloists, harp, percussion, piano, and string orchestra.
A dramatic retelling of the parable of the Good
Samaritan, it compels us to show mercy to our
neighbor. Also featured are multiple settings of the “O
vos omnes” text, alternating with inspiring works by
Rheinberger, Parry, Barber, Casals, and Elgar.

<p><b>OPERATION RICE BOWL</b>. On February 14, we begin
the Lenten season with 40 days of prayer, fasting, and
almsgiving. Almsgiving at St. James has always
involved the Catholic Relief Services Rice Bowl – the
humble little box in which we place our donations for
the many programs CRS supports throughout the
world, and in our own community. Last year,
parishioners at St. James contributed an amazing
$17,490.28 through the Rice Bowls, an increase of
17% from 2016. This year, as you pick up your Rice
Bowl after Mass, remember the important contribution
the Rice Bowl program plays in providing food,
education, medical care, disaster relief, and other
humanitarian needs to people in over 110 countries,
including our own, and give as generously as you can.
If you give online using Our Sunday Visitor, you can
make your Rice Bowl gift online as well!</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a young woman with an 
infectious smile and deep depression. Like several other women in her family, 
she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She hoped to take a leave of absence from 
her job for surgery. But she feared telling her supervisors about her condition 
and worried about the loss of income while recuperating. We helped with rent and 
urged her to apply to certain governmental agencies for more financial help. We 
also recommended other charities that help breast cancer survivors in hope they 
can help her build the happy life she deserves. Thank you for your support, 
which makes our help possible! <i>Information</i>,

Siena, Assisi, and Rome for days of

pilgrims on their way!</p>

now we have a need for just one driver on the

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Use matches instead of disposable lighters to light the
grill or fireplace or for other uses. Estimates are that
1.5 billion lighters end up in landfills each year, and
they are made of plastic and contain butane, neither of
which is environmentally friendly. Paper matches are
preferred because they are made from recycled paper.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we pray for the parishes of St. Bernadette in Seattle, Our
Lady of Lourdes in Seattle and Vancouver, and the Mission
of Our Lady of Lourdes in Wilkeson.</p>
