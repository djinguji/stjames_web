<p dir="ltr"><b>DO YOUR CHILDREN LOVE TO SING?</b> It’s not too early to start 
thinking about Fall membership in the Youth Music program at St. James! Schola 
Cantorum is our choir for children grades 3–8 (girls and boys with unchanged 
voices), and Jubilate! Young Women’s Ensemble is our advanced-level group for 
girls of high school age. Children in the choirs come from all over the 
Archdiocese; membership at St. James is not a requirement. Schola Cantorum 
rehearses on Thursday afternoons from 4:45-6:45pm, and Jubilate! on Mondays from 
4:45-6:45pm. Each ensemble provides the music for one Sunday noon Mass per 
month, and participates in annual Readings &amp; Carols, Christmas Eve Vigil Mass, 
and special liturgies throughout the year. Tuition is $80 for the semester 
beginning in September; full scholarships available for those with financial 
need. <i>Information</i>, contact

		Dear Brothers &amp; Sisters in Christ,<p>I want to sincerely offer thanks 
		for your hospitality, generosity and prayers offered for our mission 
		work in Northern Alaska. As I shared last weekend, we have 46 parishes 
		in a very remote region in an Arctic environment. The vast majority of 
		these parishes are far below the poverty level as the Native Alaskan 
		peoples live off the fruits of the land and sea. Your generosity will 
		help us continue our mission to these remote parishes in the Diocese of 
		Fairbanks that covers 410K square miles (just less than 6 times the size 
		of Washington). Many of these villages are only able to experience Mass 
		once every 6-8 weeks. Your financial assistance will pay for the 
		expensive travel in small aircraft to these locations as our priests and 
		religious serve the good people of God in Northern Alaska.</p>
<p>Be assured of my Mass intentions and prayers for your families. It was a 
great joy to chat with many of you following Mass. Let us keep one another in 
prayer! </p>
