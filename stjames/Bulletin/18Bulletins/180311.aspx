<p><b>THE SCRUTINIES</b>. Lent began in the Church as a time of
intense spiritual preparation and healing for the Elect,
those preparing to celebrate the sacraments of Baptism,
Confirmation, and First Holy Communion at the Easter
Vigil. On the third, fourth and fifth Sundays of Lent, the
Church pours out her most powerful prayers for
deliverance from sin and evil during the Scrutiny Rites.
These rites will take place at the 10:00am Mass on
March 11 and March 18. Please pick up a prayer card at
the Place of Prayer near the font and pray for our Elect
each day during this holy season. As Easter draws near,
you will be invited to write a note telling our Elect of
your prayerful support.</p>
<p><b>LENTEN ADORATION ON FRIDAY EVENINGS</b>. Each
Friday during Lent, we will have an hour of Exposition
of the Blessed Sacrament following the 5:30pm evening
Mass. It is a time for silent prayer in the presence of
Christ, lasting until 7:00pm. Stay for the whole prayer
or drop in for a few minutes.</p>
<p><b>SACRAMENT OF RECONCILIATION</b>. This Lent, there are
many opportunities to celebrate the sacrament of God’s
mercy. Confessions are heard each Saturday from
4:00—5:00pm. Our communal celebration of the
Sacrament of Penance will be Monday, March 19 at
7:30pm.</p>

goods, books, DVDs, CDs, sports equipment and other
re-sellable items. During Lent last year, dozens of
parishioners sacrificed their time to cull through
personal possessions and decide what they could part
with. The result was a huge haul for SVdP, yielding
countless treasures that were then sold through SVdP’s
five King County thrift shops. Sale proceeds benefitted
our neighbors in need. Can you help us haul away an
even bigger stash of treasures this year? <i>Information</i>,
