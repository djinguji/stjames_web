<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>THE ST. JAMES WINTER SHELTER</b> asks your help for
the following needs: men’s razors; large cans of men’s
spray deodorant; toothbrushes. Donations can be
dropped off at Coffee Hour, they can be ordered and
delivered to the Parish Office.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
young man whose hands trembled constantly due to
alcohol addiction. He had just lost his manufacturing
job because the trembling made it impossible for him
to meet the quota of items his employer required him
to make. Already in a daily addiction support group,
he wanted badly to enter a medical detox program
recommended by his counselor. Good news is he had
family and friends to help him with some of his
financial needs and an affectionate little dog for
emotional support. But he did not have quite enough to
pay his rent to keep his apartment while in detox. With your support, we gladly 
helped, confident he was highly motivated and ready to turn his life around – 
thank you! <i>Information</i>,
