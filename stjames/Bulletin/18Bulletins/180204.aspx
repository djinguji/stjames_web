	<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I am very happy to be able to announce to you that Joseph Adam
has accepted the position of Director of Music and Cathedral Organist.</p>
<p>Joseph has served as Cathedral organist since 1993, as Interim
Director of Music in 2015, and, for the past two years, as Associate
Director of Music with Dr. Paul Thornock.</p>
<p>Because you get to witness his amazing musicianship every
weekend, I hardly need to tell you what impressive credentials Joseph
brings to his new position. His skills as an organist are widely acclaimed
and rightly so. In 1991 he received First Prize at the St. Albans
International Organ Competition, the most recent American to take top
honors in this prestigious competition. In addition, he has performed
widely in this country and beyond and, for the past nine seasons, has
served as Resident Organist with the Seattle Symphony at Benaroya Hall.</p>
<p>But Joseph brings more than impressive credentials. He has been
an important part of this Cathedral community for 25 years. He loves this
place and he knows our community from the inside-out. He enjoys the
respect of the members of the Cathedral choir and of the music
community here in Seattle, as well as of the Cathedral staff. In every way,
he will be able to hit the ground running as our new director of music.</p>
<p>I am more than grateful to Joseph for his willingness to assume this
position that is such an important part of the prayer life and the artistic
life of the Cathedral. I ask you to join me in praying for God’s blessings
for him as he begins his new role, and for God’s blessings on our parish
as we move into the future.</p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
middle-aged Navy veteran struggling to pay rent
despite help from a local veterans organization. He
suffers from addictions, loneliness and depression. His
post-Navy prison record makes it hard to find work
other than occasional day-labor jobs. His only steady
income? $197 in monthly foodstamps. It was a long
visit. He was very emotional. We helped with rent, but
mainly he thanked us for taking time to listen to him
talk about things that he said he never talks to anyone
about. We felt privileged to do that, and we thank you
for your support – you make caring visits like this
possible. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
"How can we genuinely teach the importance of
concern for other vulnerable beings, however
troublesome or inconvenient they may be, if we fail to
protect a human embryo, even when its presence is
uncomfortable and creates difficulties?” (<i>Laudato Sì</i>,
paragraph 120)</p>
<p><b>VAN DRIVER NEEDED</b>. Our Sunday van ministry is an
important outreach to senior parishioners who would
not be able to get to 10:00am Mass on Sunday if it
weren’t for our drivers. It’s a simple but important way
to reach out to some of our senior parishioners! Right
now we have a need for just one driver on the
fourth Sunday of the month. All training provided;
background check required. <i>Information</i>,
