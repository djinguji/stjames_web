<p><b>MARK YOUR CALENDAR FOR SVDP’S “STUFF THE
TRUCK” EVENT</b>. On Sunday, April 22 (8:00am-
2:30pm), a St Vincent de Paul truck will be in the
O’Dea parking lot to receive your donations of gently
used clothes, shoes, kitchen and other household
goods, books, DVDs, CDs, sports equipment and other
re-sellable items. During Lent last year, dozens of
parishioners sacrificed their time to cull through
personal possessions and decide what they could part
with. The result was a huge haul for SVdP, yielding
countless treasures that were then sold through SVdP’s
five King County thrift shops. Proceeds benefitted our
neighbors in need. Can you help us haul away an even
bigger stash of treasures this year? <i>Information</i>, Ken
Goddard, 206-981-7185.</p>

<p><b>ENVIRONMENTAL FAIR 2018</b>. The Care for Creation
committee will be hosting its annual Environmental
Fair on Sunday, April 29 after the 10am and 12 Noon
Masses. As we approach the 3rd anniversary of Pope
Francis’ encyclical on the environment, <i>Laudato Si’</i>,
we hope that the Fair will be an opportunity to become
informed and take action in ways to protect and
nurture our environment, promoting a healthier
environment for all.</p>
