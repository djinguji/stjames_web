<p><b>THE SCRUTINIES</b>. Lent began in the Church as a time of
intense spiritual preparation and healing for the Elect,
those preparing to celebrate the sacraments of Baptism,
Confirmation, and First Holy Communion at the Easter
Vigil. On the third, fourth and fifth Sundays of Lent, the
Church pours out her most powerful prayers for
deliverance from sin and evil during the Scrutiny Rites.
These rites will take place at the 10:00am Mass on
March 4, March 11, and March 18. Please pick up a
prayer card at the Place of Prayer near the font and pray
for our Elect each day during this holy season. As Easter
draws near, you will be invited to write a note telling
our Elect of your prayerful support.</p>
<p><b>PARISH PILGRIMAGE UPDATES</b>. Today, Father Ryan

the opportunity to pray in Assisi at the shrines of Saint
Francis and Saint Clare, as well as to celebrate Mass at
the tomb of St. Paul. To see photos of the pilgrimage
