<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the

Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. When we help
parish residents, two Vincentians go together to their
homes for a friendly visit. On one recent evening we
made three stops, visiting a nanny, an artist/musician
and a security guard – all currently employed. Each
tries hard to make ends meet, but each needed rent
help (which we gave) due to unexpected expenses, too
few work hours or low wages. All three spontaneously
displayed wonderful attitudes: upbeat, positive, with
hope in their hearts and very grateful for the help. As
Vincentians, we see the difficult circumstances faced
by those needing help, but when we meet them in
person, we also see the beauty, strength and resilience
of their humanity. Thank you for your support!

to start thinking about Fall membership in the Youth
Music program at St. James! Schola Cantorum is our
choir for children grades 3–8 (girls and boys with
unchanged voices), and Jubilate! Young Women’s
Ensemble is our advanced-level group for girls of high
school age. Children in the choirs come from all over
the Archdiocese; membership at St. James is not a
requirement. Schola Cantorum rehearses on Thursday
afternoons from 4:45-6:45pm, and Jubilate! on
Mondays from 4:45-6:45pm. Each ensemble provides
the music for one Sunday noon Mass per month, and
participates in annual Readings & Carols, Christmas
Eve Vigil Mass, and special liturgies throughout the
year. Tuition is $80 for the semester beginning in
September; full scholarships available for those with
financial need. For more information, contact

<p><b>ST. JAMES STAFF CHANGES</b>. This past week, we said
farewell to Hunt Hoffman, who has served for the last
two years as the assistant to the Social Outreach and to
the Young Adult ministries. During his time at St.
James, Hunt particularly served all who came to
Cathedral Hall every Sunday morning at Coffee Hour.
May God’s blessings be with Hunt as he continues his
journey! We also welcome Jamerika Haynes and
Dylan Hogan, who will serve as administrative
coordinators for Young Adults and for Social
Outreach. As the Cathedral’s ministries continue to
grow, they will help develop the Cathedral’s reach in
the community.</p>

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Try going meatless on Fridays. According to the EPA,
livestock production accounts for 9% of Americans’
greenhouse gas emissions. By going meatless one day
per week, you’ll both honor a Catholic tradition and
better care for creation.</p>
