<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<b>FOR YOUR SAFETY</b>. At each of the weekend Masses a Seattle police officer 
is present on the Cathedral campus. </td></tr></table>

<p><b>ON THE COVER</b>. During the month of November, when
we remember all our beloved dead, we acknowledge in a
special way the debt of gratitude we owe to those who
over the past decades have remembered the Cathedral in
their will.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered by Bridget Cooley
in loving memory of her father, Charlie McIntyre, on the
tenth anniversary of his death.</p>
<p><b>NOON MASS CHILDREN’S PROCESSION TODAY</b>. We
invite all children to participate in an entrance procession
honoring our Saints. Meet in the West Vestibule at
11:53. Parents, please accompany very young children.</p>
<p><b>FEED YOUR HEART!</b> You are invited to a one-of-a kind
special event hosted by L’Arche and Fr. Steve Sundborg,
President of Seattle University. Sr. Sue Mosteller from
Toronto will speak from her experience of her many
years sharing deep friendships with people who have
developmental disabilities and her leadership within the
L'Arche movement. Monday November 12, 7:30-9:00pm
in the Father LeRoux, S.J. Conference Center at Seattle
University. Complimentary parking is available at 12th
& Marion or Broadway & E. Columbia lots.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. An experienced longshoreman wound up 
unemployed and homeless for nearly a year after his licenses and credentials 
expired when he could not afford to pay renewal fees. Your Cathedral Vincentians 
learned about this only after he started to get work again, found housing but 
mistakenly thought the agency that housed him would pay his rent for awhile. 
When we visited, he was deeply anxious, upset and feeling ashamed about getting 
an eviction notice and needing to ask for help. With your support, we eased his 
anxiety by paying rent and assured him there was nothing to be ashamed about as 
most people hit a rough patch sometime in life and, with his skills and 
experience, he has much to look forward to. Thank you for making such help and 
our visits possible! <i>Information</i>,

		Dear Friends,<p>I want to give you a quick update on the
C<span style="font-variant: small-caps">alled to </span>S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">erve 
		as </span>C<span style="font-variant: small-caps">hrist</span> Campaign, which we
launched two months ago. Good news! We have
already raised 82% of our goal of $3.2 million, and
I have every confidence that with your help, we’ll
raise the remaining $620,000. A huge thank you to
those of you who have already made a commitment
to the campaign. For those who have not yet done
so, I hope you will consider becoming a part of this
important effort in support of the retired sisters and
priests of the archdiocese. We intend to follow up
with all those we have not yet heard from early in
the New Year.</p>
<p>Your incredible generosity once again moves
me very deeply. It is such a testimonial to your faith
and to your love for the Church. Thank you with all
my heart!</p>
