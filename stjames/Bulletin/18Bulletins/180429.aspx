Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral

<p><b>ENVIRONMENTAL FAIR 2018</b>. The St. James Care for
Creation committee invites everyone to Cathedral Hall
after today’s 10am and 12 Noon Mass for their annual
Environmental Fair. Over 20 exhibitors will be on hand,
so that you can learn more and take action to become
better stewards of the Earth!</p>
<p><b>ROSARY IN HONOR OF MARY</b>. Next Sunday, May 6, join
the children of St James for a rosary in honor of Mary
immediately following the Noon Mass.</p>
<p><b>APRIL IS NATIONAL CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION
MONTH</b>. St James is committed to maintaining a safe
environment for children, youth and vulnerable adults.
All employees and volunteers who work with these

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
As we finally head into the warmer days of spring and
summer, try to use air conditioning sparingly on
particularly warm days. AC uses more energy and
contributes to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in
the atmosphere, and it also has been demonstrated to
have negative health effects, particularly for respiratory
and some chronic conditions.</p>

<p><b>FATHER MICHAEL G. RYAN</b> draws the series to a close
reflecting on the images of the Blessed Virgin Mary

	<p><b>HELP FOR SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING</b>.
Do you know anyone who has a room, Mother-in-Law
apartment, sublet, or Airbnb they would agree to
temporarily rent to survivors of domestic violence and/or human trafficking? It is a significant struggle to find
temporary, transitional, or permanent housing for these
folks, especially for men. One of our partner agencies
is supporting them financially and with other services
while they wait for their work permits. <i>Information</i>:

<p><b>THE ART OF FAITH WORKSHOP FOR TEENS</b>. This year we have been 
commissioned to make processional banners for use in the Mass of the Feast of St 
James. To that end, we will experience how banners are used in various settings, 
be inspired by the Cathedral’s banner collection and learn about liturgical 
colors and symbols. The workshop is from July 16 to July 20 from 9am to 4pm. In 
addition, teens are encouraged to attend the 10am or Noon Mass on July 22 in 
order to carry the banners they have created. As in years past, the cost is 
$100, which covers snacks and all materials. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>REPORT FROM ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b>. With your help
on Earth Day (April 22), our Cathedral Vincentians
stuffed a 24-foot SVdP truck full of clothes and other
re-sellable items for SVdP’s Seattle clothing bank and
King County thrift stores. During January, February &
March, your financial donations made it possible for
us to do 162 home visits and help 201 low (or no)
income residents of St James parish who struggle to
pay for life's necessities, such as rent, electricity, beds,
food, clothes and basic hygiene products. We and
those we serve are deeply grateful for all you share
with SVdP – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>PREPARES VOLUNTEERS ACCOMPANY YOUNG
FAMILY</b>. Our new Pregnancy and Parenting Support
Program (PREPARES) is establishing supportive
relationships with parents and families throughout our
community. Here is a recent account from a volunteer
couple: “Six months ago my husband and I were
partnered with a family who had come to Catholic
Community Services for help with food and clothing.
The parents of a 6-month old had been homeless and
had suffered from problems with addiction, but now
had been clean and sober for two years. They
continued to follow up with their recovery program,
but with very limited family, this was their only
support system. As PREPARES volunteers, our role is
to be supportive and non-judgmental companions to
these parents. We meet weekly to go to the food bank,
share a meal or cup of coffee, or just go for a walk. We
strive to be good friends and listeners. Recently we
attended the birthday party for their now 1-year old
toddler, who is a beautiful and happy little boy.”</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN BECOMING CATHOLIC?</b> If
you are an adult who has never been baptized, an adult
who has been baptized in another Christian tradition or
a Catholic who has been baptized, but not received
First Eucharist or Confirmation, you are invited to
participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the
Catholic Church. You can learn more by visting the 
<a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA">RCIA website</a>. <i>Information</i>,
