<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered by a parishioner in
loving memory of her husband on the anniversary of his
death and the Feast of St. Thérèse of Lisieux. Flowers are
also from the Saturday wedding of Erin Tyack and Steven
Thompson.</p>
<p><b>PRAY THE WAY OF THE CROSS</b>. As we continue to deal
with the aftermath of the clergy sexual abuse scandal in
the Church, you are invited to pray the Way of the
Cross. Near the first station in the South Transept, you’ll
find booklets with meditations and prayers that speak to
this moment.</p>
<p><b>CLERGY ABUSE CRISIS LISTENING SESSIONS</b><br>
&nbsp;•  Wednesday, October 10, 6.30pm, Cathedral Hall<br>
&nbsp;•  Saturday, October 20, 2.30pm, Cathedral Hall<br>
St. James Cathedral will host two listening sessions
focused on the clergy sexual abuse crisis. Each session
will offer the opportunity to break into facilitated small
listening groups to allow for deep listening and sharing
for each participant. To ensure that this process is
successful, it is important to know how many to expect.
<i>Archbishop Sartain has invited us to share the results of
the listening sessions with him so that he can take them to
the meeting of the US Bishops in November</i>. Please RSVP

<p><b>ARCHDIOCESAN RED MASS</b> will be celebrated by
Archbishop Sartain on Saturday, October 6 at 10:00am
in the Cathedral. The “Red Mass” for all who work in
the legal profession is a tradition going back to the 13th
century. Called the “Red Mass” because of the color of
the vestments worn, this is a time to pray that the Holy
Spirit will inspire all lawyers, judges, government
officials, law school professors, and the entire legal
community to seek truth and justice with integrity. All
are welcome.</p>

<p><b>OUR MARRIAGE ENRICHMENT DINNERS</b> continue

<p><b>KITCHEN VOLUNTEERS NEEDED</b>. The Cathedral
Kitchen needs a Tuesday gleaner. Gleaners go out in
the morning to local supermarkets and collect food
(fruits, vegetables, milk, deli items, etc.) These items
are used in our daily meals. It’s a fun and rewarding
outreach! We also need a few more volunteers to help
with cooking, preparing, serving meals, and clean-up.

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. St Vincent de
Paul once said, “Love is inventive to the point of
infinity.” For our Cathedral Vincentians, that can mean
talking with a landlord who, at heart, does not want to
evict a tenant who has fallen behind in rent but needs a
friendly nudge to find a path to mercy that works for
both landlord and tenant – like a payment plan so the
tenant can catch up with arrears over time. Sometimes
“inventive love” simply means being courteous and
respectful – one man told us he called 25 charitable
organizations asking for help and SVdP was the only
one who bothered to call him back. And sometimes
love can be shown just by “making up the difference”
between the $13 left in a man’s pocket and the balance
due on his rent – as we saw not long ago with an
elderly man who called for our help. Your support for
SVdP helps many of our parish residents financially and in a way that shows them 
God’s infinite, inventive love. Thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>BYRD ENSEMBLE CONCERT</b> Saturday, October 13 at
8:00pm. Sacred music serves a liturgical purpose, and
sometimes, a political one as well. Each piece on the
program comes with an interesting story, giving us a
sense of the intertwined religious and political
turbulence of the time. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
October 4 is the Feast of St. Francis, patron saint of the
earth. October 4 is also the close of the Season of
Creation. This year, Pope Francis has called on all
people of good will to be more conscientious about
water. Let us echo St. Francis’ prayer: “Praised be You
my Lord through Sister Water, so useful, humble,
precious and pure.”</p>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we pray for the parishes of St. Michael in Olympia and
Snohomish, St. Gabriel in Port Orchard, and St. Jerome in
Ocean Shores.</p>
