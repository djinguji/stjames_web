“We are incredibly grateful for your support of the Hunthausen Fund and the Solanus Casey Center and
our ongoing partnership with St. James. The
Hunthausen Fund has helped 13 families (18 adults

so far this year. The funds you provide allow us to
serve up to three families per month. The Solanus
Casey Center continues to welcome a steady stream of
folks in need of assistance and the funds provided by
St. James will increase their capacity to help. Thank
you again for your support and dedication to our
shared mission!”</p>
