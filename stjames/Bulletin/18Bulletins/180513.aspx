<p><b>MAY IS MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH</b>.
Tragically, an estimated two-thirds of all young people
with mental health problems are not getting the help
they need. Most often, children’s and adolescent’s
mental health problems are not recognized for what
they are and appropriate help is not sought. The stigma
associated with mental health problems often acts as a
barrier to getting help. It causes isolation and
discrimination for young people and their families.

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited an elderly woman who shared 
many stories of growing up in a poor family as one of 12 children – so many 
children that she was given to grandma to raise her. She said grandma was very 
kind and taught her the most important lesson in life: not to talk so much but, 
instead, to “listen, really listen!” The only material aid this gentle woman 
asked of us was a little help for food. What she wanted most was simply a good 
conversation with us. Thank you for giving us, as your Cathedral Vincentians, 
the opportunity to “listen, really listen” to so many wonderful people who long 
to be heard.

<p><b>CRS RICE BOWL</b>. The results are in, and once again,
our parish has generously supported the work of CRS
through our contributions to the Rice Bowl. This year,
we exceeded last year’s Rice Bowl collection by 18% -
a check was sent to the Missions Office for
$21,300.15. Thank you so much! St. James continues
to be one of the top Rice Bowl contributors in our
Archdiocese. And by the way, our Archdiocese is first
in the nation in terms of both contributions and
participation (100%)! And remember, 25% of every
dollar raised stays right here in our community,
funding nearly 300 anti-hunger projects, including the
St. James Kitchen and our new garden project.</p>

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Are you traveling this summer? Consider taking home
the toiletries that are in your hotel room, and offer
them to the Winter Shelter. Shampoo, conditioner,
lotion and soap are always in demand. By bringing
home these items, you will stop them from
immediately being thrown into a landfill. Even a small
quantity left in the toiletry bottles is helpful in
maintaining personal hygiene for the day.</p>
<p><b>JUVENILE JUSTICE CIRCLES</b>. The St. James Juvenile
Justice Committee is hosting a peacemaking circle in
May. St. James is the only Catholic parish that is
serving as a resource for restorative justice work with
juveniles in King County and it is important for our
success that we acquire the skills and experience that
will enable us to take on this important work. To learn
more, contact
