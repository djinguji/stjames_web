<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

Week liturgies and a short film capturing highlights of

<p><b>CATHOLIC 101: EUCHARIST, EMBODIMENT OF LOVE</b>

<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN GARDEN IS BACK!</b> Starting
very soon, we will, once again, be growing vegetables
and fruits for the Cathedral Kitchen to serve as part of
their delicious and healthy meals to those in need. But
we need your help! We are currently seeking raised
beds, soil, and volunteers to help set up and plant the
garden. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>CELEBRATE EARTH DAY WITH SVDP</b>. As Pope Francis
has written, “Re-using something instead of
immediately discarding it, when done for the right
reasons, can be an act of love which expresses our own
dignity.” On Earth Day (Sunday, April 22), St Vincent
de Paul will make it easy for you to follow that good
advice. Bring your donations of gently used clothes,
shoes, kitchen and other household goods, books,
DVDs, CDs, sports equipment and other re-sellable
items to the SVdP truck that will be in the O’Dea
parking lot from 8am to 2:30pm. Your gifts will find
new homes through our local SVdP clothing bank and
thrift stores, and sale proceeds will benefit our
neighbors in need. Truly an act of love! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>PAX CHRISTI AT ST JAMES</b>. Visit our Pax Christi peace
and justice group at 1:15pm (after the Noon Mass) on
April 8 in the Pastoral Outreach Center. We meet the
second Sunday of each month. Come to learn more
about working for peace and justice in our world.

<p><b>ENVIRONMENTAL FAIR 2018</b>. The Care for Creation
committee will be hosting its annual Environmental
Fair on Sunday, April 29 after the 10am and 12 Noon
Masses. As we approach the 3rd anniversary of Pope
Francis’ encyclical on the environment, <i>Laudato Si’</i>,
we hope that the Fair will be an opportunity to become
informed and take action in ways to protect and
nurture our environment, promoting a healthier
environment for all.</p>
<p><b>HELP FOR SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING</b>.
Do you know anyone who has a room, Mother-in-Law
apartment, sublet, or Airbnb they would agree to
temporarily rent to survivors of domestic violence and/
or human trafficking? It is a significant struggle to find
temporary, transitional, or permanent housing for these
folks, especially for men. One of our partner agencies
is supporting them financially and with other services
while they wait for their work permits. <i>Information</i>:

Men’s Winter Shelter will operate, before taking a
summer break. In order to provide hospitality, are you
able to donate spray deodorant, cough drops, razors or
body lotion? Donations can be brought to Sunday
Coffee Hour or the parish office. Thank you!</p>
<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
As much as 95% of clothes, shoes and linens thrown in
the garbage could be reused or recycled. A number of
local organizations will accept all clothes (except those
that are wet, mildewed or contaminated with
hazardous materials)—even damaged or mismatched
items. To learn where you can take these items, see
<a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/threadcycle">www.kingcounty.gov/threadcycle</a>.</p>

<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never
officially registered. We strongly encourage you to
register. Registered parishioners receive important
mailings from the Cathedral (including offering
envelopes!). Registration cards can be found in the
vestibule and at the welcome table in Cathedral Hall.
You can also register online at www.stjames-cathedral.org.</p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN IS ACCEPTING
APPLICATIONS</b> for our Kitchen Greeter position. The
job includes greeting meal guests and monitoring the
dining hall during our daily serving of meals. The job
also requires unloading the gleaning van, sorting its
contents, and cleaning and closing up the Kitchen at
the end of day. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>JOB OPENING</b>. The Cathedral has an opening for a
custodian to perform basic janitorial responsibilities.
This person will also work with the Cathedral
Facilities staff in setting up for special events. This is a
full time position with an Archdiocesan Benefits
package. To receive a job description and details,

and send it with a resume, via e-mail, to

<p><b>TAX FRAUD COMMUNICATION</b>. We have learned that
six individuals have been charged in the 2013 tax
fraud scheme that affected some employees and
volunteers of the Archdiocese of Seattle. Five of these
individuals have been convicted on multiple counts of
mail and wire fraud and related charges. Two have
been sentenced to federal prison (a 6 year and a 9 year
term). The other three are awaiting sentencing.
Although these convictions do not change the fact that
many of our employees and volunteers experienced
stress and a tremendous amount of inconvenience, it is
reassuring to know that at least some of the individuals
responsible are being held accountable for their
crimes. We have been told that the large number of
employees and volunteers who attended regional
gatherings and signed affidavits for the IRS agents was
helpful to their investigation.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN BECOMING CATHOLIC?</b> If
you are an adult who has never been baptized, an adult
who has been baptized in another Christian tradition or
a Catholic who has been baptized, but not received
First Eucharist or Confirmation, you are invited to
participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the
Catholic Church. You can learn more by visting the 
<a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA">RCIA website</a>. <i>Information</i>,

week we pray for the parishes of Star of the Sea in Bremerton
and Port Townsend, and Our Lady of Good Counsel Mission
