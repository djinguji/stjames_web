world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Designate certain rooms in your home, or certain hours
of the day (or both!), as tech-free zones. This allows
more time for contemplation, reading books or
newspapers, or praying. It also allows more time for
meaningful interaction with family members and
friends, all of which leads to a greater appreciation of
our world.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Sometimes we
leave a home visit with big smiles on our faces – like
the time we visited a bright, determined young woman
who needed rent help after incurring unexpected
medical bills. We had just handed her a SVdP rent
voucher when she asked if we could advise her on
finding a husband! She said her goal was to get married
in a year, but she had no one in mind. We had a jolly
chat, with each of us sharing a bit of our own life
experience and “wisdom” on the subject. As we left,
the young woman asked us to pray for her and to pray
that her “fiancee will come soon.” Thank you for your
prayers for our SVdP mission to help our neighbors in need! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>SUNDAY COFFEE HOUR VOLUNTEERS NEEDED</b>. St.
James hosts a Coffee Hour in the Cathedral Hall on
Sundays after the 8am, 10am, and 12pm Masses. It is a
welcoming space in which persons experiencing
homelessness and parishioners can come together to
drink coffee, eat pastries, relax, and socialize. It is also
a great place to learn about the array of ministries and
volunteer opportunities at St. James. We are in need of
volunteers to serve coffee and pastries and help clean
up after each Mass. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>CULTURAL COMPANIONS</b>. In partnership with a local
agency supporting refugees, we are seeking volunteers
to be cultural companions to visit refugee families 3-4
times per month for six months in order to practice
English, build friendship, explore the community
together, answer questions about life in America, and
offer support as families get settled into their new lives
here. <i>Information</i>,

cathedral’s new Pregnancy and Parenting Support
Ministry, PREPARES, offers unconditional, nurturing
care to families from pregnancy through a child’s fifth
birthday. PREPARES recognizes that parents need love
and ongoing community support in order to choose life
in difficult circumstances. We are forming teams of
volunteers to work with a parent or family over the
long haul. We already have a waiting list of pregnant
mothers, single parents, and young families who have
asked for help. Please consider stepping forward.
