<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Sometimes God makes it easy to see 
Jesus in the face of those we visit. Earlier during this Advent season, we got a 
call for help from a young Jewish carpenter. He has seen much misfortune and 
sadness in his own life and in the lives of his friends, some of which he shared 
with us. The sheriff was going to evict him the next day because he was behind 
in paying rent. With your support, we were able to provide just enough rent help 
to keep a roof over his head during this holy season - thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>PREPARES MINISTRY NEEDS VOLUNTEERS</b>. The cathedral’s new Pregnancy and 
Parenting Support Ministry, PREPARES, offers unconditional, nurturing care to 
families from pregnancy through a child’s fifth birthday. PREPARES recognizes 
that parents need love and ongoing community support in order to choose life in 
difficult circumstances. St. James Cathedral is the first parish to launch 
PREPARES in central Seattle. We are forming teams of volunteers to work with a 
parent or family over the long haul. The model is similar to our existing AIDS 
Care Teams. Although the PREPARES is brand new, we already have a waiting list 
of pregnant mothers, single parents, and young families who have asked for help. 
PREPARES is the ideal ministry for people who want to live out their commitment 
to social and economic justice and their belief in the dignity of every human 
life. Please consider stepping forward.
