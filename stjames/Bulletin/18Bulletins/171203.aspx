<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>CHILDREN’S PROCESSION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NOON MASS TODAY</b>. All children are welcome to help
us to celebrate the beginning of Advent. Meet in the
West Vestibule at 11:53. Parents, please accompany
very young children.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><b>SPECIAL MASS SCHEDULE FOR CHRISTMAS EVE AND
CHRISTMAS DAY</b>. With Christmas Eve falling on a
Sunday this year, please note some changes to our
schedule for Sunday, December 24. The 8:00am and
10:00am Masses will take place as usual. Note that
these will be Masses for the Fourth Sunday of Advent,
NOT Christmas Masses. <b>In order to prepare for the
Christmas liturgies, there will be no Noon Mass or
Vespers on Christmas Eve</b>. The Christmas liturgies
will begin with the 5:30pm Vigil Mass of Christmas on
December 24. The Mass of Christmas Night will follow
at 10:00pm. On Christmas Day, Masses will be at
8:00am, 10:00am, Noon, and 5:30pm, with Vespers of
Christmas Day at 4:00pm.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Recently we
called a senior citizen who asked for rent help, only to
learn he no longer needed help. Good news for him but
even better news for us was what he said: “Just hearing
from someone means a lot to me.” He then spoke with
great warmth about how important it is just to get "a
phone call from someone who cares." When residents
of our parish call the SVdP Helpline (206-767-6449),
they talk to a real human being, not a recording. The
request is then forwarded to our SVdP group at St
James and, if we can help, two more “real, live human
beings” do a home visit, taking along their commonsense
brains and compassionate hearts. Real human
beings who care. That is part of what makes SVdP
special. Your financial support and prayers fuel our
work, and we thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
This Christmas, save wrapping paper for later use;
reuse old wrapping paper for this year's gifts or use a
fun alternative such as color newspaper comics.
Instead of a material gift, consider donating on
someone's behalf to a food bank, homeless shelter or
other charity.</p>
<p><b>THE ADVENT GIVING TREE</b> is located in the Cathedral
(by the Marion and Terry doors) and at Coffee Hour.
Consider taking a tag, buying the gift, then returning it
to the Parish Office, the Bookstore or at Coffee Hour.
One of the beneficiaries of your gifts is the Frederic Ozanam House, located across the street from the
Cathedral. This Catholic Housing Services program
offers housing and other services to senior men
experiencing chronic homelessness. The facility offers
56 single-occupancy apartments as well as a meal
service, on-site case managers, and a chemical
dependency case manager. Another agency that will
receive gifts is King County Juvenile Detention, which
is responsible for the care and custody of youth in
detention. While in detention, youth attend school and
have access to a wide range of programs and services.
The focus is on rehabilitation, not punishment, and
ensuring community safety. King County is committed
to helping youth involved in Juvenile Court develop
into healthy, productive adults.</p>
<p><b>STAR LIGHT: THE EPIPHANY PARTY FOR CHILDREN
