<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Several years ago
we helped a young woman with rent who was just
starting a manual labor job and had almost no money.
A year later she contacted us to thank us for that help
and report she had gotten a new job as a custodian at a
local college. Recently she thanked us again, wanting
us to know she had gotten her college degree and was
leaving to study at a university in China. She
remembered our rent help but mainly she remembered
our kind, supportive visit, which gave her great
encouragement. Our visits are fueled by the financial
support you give SVdP—thank you!

<p><b>BAPTISM OF INFANTS & YOUNG CHILDREN</b> (under the
age of 7) is celebrated monthly at one of the weekend
Masses. To prepare for this most important sacrament,
parents and godparents participate in a series of classes
to update their understanding of baptism, to reflect on
their responsibility to guide their children in the
practice of the faith, and to learn about the many ways
our parish supports families. Please allow at least two
months for preparation. <i>Information</i>, Julianna Castro,

<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.

consider the Cathedral their parish have never
officially registered. We strongly encourage you to
register. Registered parishioners receive important
mailings from the Cathedral. Registration cards can be found at the welcome table in Cathedral Hall.
You can also register online at www.stjames-cathedral.org.</p>
<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Practice observing, and appreciating, the beauty in all
aspects of creation that surround you. “If someone has
not learned to stop and admire something beautiful, we
should not be surprised if he or she treats everything as
an object to be used and abused without
scruple.” (Laudato Si’, 215)</p>

THE CHILDREN OF ST JAMES</b>. The Children’s Faith
Formation Program has a few openings for catechists,
