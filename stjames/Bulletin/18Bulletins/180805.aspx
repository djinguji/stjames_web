<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<b>FOR YOUR SAFETY</b>. At each of the weekend Masses a Seattle police officer 
is present on the Cathedral campus. </td></tr></table>
<p><b>ON THE COVER</b>. <i>Christ at the Last Supper</i>. Blessed
Sacrament Chapel, St. James Cathedral.</p>
<p><b>NEW ON THE WEBSITE</b>. If you were unable to be at
Archbishop Hunthausen’s funeral services last Tuesday
and Wednesday, you can still read or listen to Father
Ryan’s homily online. There is an album of photos
posted as well. </p>
<p><b>WINTER SHELTER DONATIONS</b>. If you are travelling this
summer, consider bringing home the toiletries that are
provided in your hotel rooms. Bring them to Coffee
Hour or to the Parish Office so that they can be used by
the men who stay at the Winter Shelter. Not only are you
keeping a few more plastics out of the garbage, but you
are sharing valuable hygiene products with our overnight
guests. Thank you!</p>
<p><b>OUTREACH SUNDAY</b>. Join representatives from several
of the Cathedral’s Outreach Ministries at Coffee Hour in
Cathedral Hall, today after the 10am Mass. They will be
on hand to share some of the work they are doing in our
community. You may also want to learn more so that
you can become involved!</p>
<p><b>FROM HIROSHIMA TO HOPE</b>. On Monday August 6, Pax
Christi members will attend "From Hiroshima to Hope,”
which honors victims of war and the atomic bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This annual event begins at 6
pm near the Bathhouse Theater at Green Lake, 7312
West Green Lake Drive North, and includes music, a
program, and a floating lantern ceremony. Please
consider joining us there. <i>Information</i>, visit

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
During these warmer summer days, try to use air-conditioning
sparingly. AC uses more energy and
contributes to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in
the atmosphere. It also has been demonstrated to have
negative health effects, particularly for those with
respiratory issues and some chronic conditions.</p>
