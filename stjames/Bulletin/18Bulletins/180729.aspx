<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>The death last Sunday of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen marks the passing of
an era. He was the last living American bishop to have participated in the Second
Vatican Council, and was one of only eight living bishops in the entire world who had
participated in all four sessions of the Council.</p>
<p>But the archbishop was more than a living legend: he was an extraordinary leader,
a compassionate shepherd, and a courageous prophet. For 16 years, this archdiocese
was blessed by his leadership and for most of those 16 years, I was privileged to serve
as his chancellor and vicar general. It was one of the greatest graces and blessings of
my life.</p>
<p>Any of you who knew the archbishop, don’t need any words from me to tell you
what a truly remarkable person he was. He was a gentle giant: humble, unassuming,
approachable, and keenly intelligent. He had the common touch and loved nothing
more than being with the people he served. And he listened to the people he served—to their hopes and dreams, their heartaches and struggles. Archbishop Hunthausen
truly believed that the Holy Spirit is alive in the Church and speaks in the Church—the
whole Church—not just the ordained.</p>
<p>And even though dealing with the terrible scandal of clergy sexual abuse involved
a learning curve for him as it did for all bishops, when it came to putting into place
enlightened polices and protocols, he was a leader among the United States bishops.
His initiatives made the Archdiocese of Seattle a recognized leader among the dioceses
of this country.</p>
<p>But it was his courageous witness to peace that put him on the world stage, and
rightly so. Even though the economy of this region was fueled in great measure by the
arms race, he was fearless in speaking out against it. No other bishop put his life and
reputation on the line for peace and nuclear disarmament like Archbishop
Hunthausen. Ecumenism was another of the Archbishop’s passions. He energetically
engaged in inter-faith dialogue and built bridges of love and understanding that
inspired many outside the Church—clergy and lay—to regard him as “our bishop.”</p>
<p>Archbishop Hunthausen will be laid to rest in the Cathedral crypt this coming
Wednesday, August 1, following the 11:00am funeral Mass. The Mass will be open to
the public (as will all the funeral liturgies—see the complete schedule in today’s
bulletin). I encourage as many of you as possible to attend. I can’t guarantee every one
of you a seat but I can guarantee a beautiful and moving celebration – history in the
making.</p>

	<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. During our home
visits, we are often deeply moved by the people we
meet, what they tell us about their lives, their struggles
and joys and how they cope with whatever life hands
them. Recently, one of our members recalled visiting a
woman who had fled domestic violence with a small
child suffering from chronic, life-threatening health
issues. She had just gotten a full-time job and an
apartment. All she asked of us was a little help to buy
clothes for herself and her son and some food required
by her son’s special diet that they cannot get free from
food banks. During the visit, our member found
himself thinking, “I’d better listen to what I’m being
told here!” Your financial support makes visits like
this possible and, equally important, fosters greater
understanding, empathy and compassion for our
neighbors – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>WINTER SHELTER DONATIONS</b>. If you are travelling
this summer, consider bringing home the toiletries that
are provided in your hotel rooms. Bring them to
Coffee Hour or to the Parish Office so that they can be
used by the men who stay at the Winter Shelter. Not
only are you keeping a few more plastics out of the
garbage, but you are sharing valuable hygiene products
with our overnight guests. Thank you!</p>
<p><b>NEW LGBTQ MINISTRY AT ST. MARY'S PARISH</b>. LGBTQ Catholics are welcomed to a new ministry
based in spirituality, community-building, and service.
We meet 2nd and 4th Tuesdays at St. Mary's Father
Tony Haycock Parish Center, 2021 S. Weller St., 7-9
pm. Our next gathering will be August 10. Come
celebrate our unique spiritual gifts (Eph 4:11) in an
affirming community, with prayer, art, faith-sharing,
lectio divina, education, and service.
