<p><b>HELP FOR SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING</b>.
Do you know anyone who has a room, Mother-in-Law
apartment, sublet, or Airbnb they would agree to
temporarily rent to survivors of domestic violence and/or human trafficking? It is a significant struggle to find
temporary, transitional, or permanent housing for these
folks, especially for men. One of our partner agencies
is supporting them financially and with other services
while they wait for their work permits. <i>Information</i>:

<p><b>CELEBRATE EARTH DAY WITH SVDP</b>. As Pope Francis
has written, “Re-using something instead of
immediately discarding it, when done for the right
reasons, can be an act of love which expresses our own
dignity.” On Earth Day (Sunday, April 22), St Vincent
de Paul will make it easy for you to follow that good
advice. Bring your donations of gently used clothes,
shoes, kitchen and other household goods, books,
DVDs, CDs, sports equipment and other re-sellable
items to the SVdP truck that will be in the O’Dea
parking lot from 8am to 2:30pm. Your gifts will find
new homes through our local SVdP clothing bank and
thrift stores, and sale proceeds will benefit our
neighbors in need. Truly an act of love! <i>Information</i>,

Center, Mother Cabrini Room. Enter through patio on

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
“Disinterested concern for others, and the rejection of
every form of self-centeredness and self-absorption,
are essential if we truly wish to care for our brothers
and sisters and for the natural environment. These
attitudes also attune us to the moral imperative of
assessing the impact of our every action and personal
decision on the world around us.” <i>Laudato Si’</i></p>
<p><b>THE ART OF FAITH WORKSHOP FOR TEENS</b>. This year we have been 
commissioned to make processional banners for use in the Mass of the Feast of St 
James. To that end, we will experience how banners are used in various settings, 
be inspired by the Cathedral’s banner collection and learn about liturgical 
colors and symbols. The workshop is from July 16 to July 20 from 9am to 4pm. In 
addition, teens are encouraged to attend the 10am or Noon Mass on July 22 in 
order to carry the banners they have created. As in years past, the cost is 
$100, which covers snacks and all materials. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we pray for the parishes of Sacred Heart in Battle
Ground and Enumclaw.</p>
