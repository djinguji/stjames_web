<p><b>THE ST. JAMES WINTER SHELTER</b> asks your help for

dropped off at Coffee Hour, they can be ordered and
delivered to the Parish Office.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Sometimes when we help people, they say 
they want to pay us back some day. We typically suggest they “pay it forward” 
instead, helping someone else with money or a simple act of kindness. One 
afternoon we helped an elderly woman in a large apartment building. On our way 
out, she rode the elevator down with us. On the elevator, another elderly woman 
who had visibly painful leg and hip problems admired her chair walker on wheels, 
saying she could really use something like that. The woman we were visiting 
immediately offered to give this stranger an older chair walker on wheels that 
she still had. By the time we left the building, both women were smiling and 
heading back upstairs to complete the gift. Your support makes precious moments 
like this possible – thank you!

<p><b>THE ARCHDIOCESE OF SEATTLE</b> urges anyone who
suspects abuse by any Church personnel to contact
local law enforcement. In addition, anyone who has
knowledge of sexual abuse or misconduct by a
member of the clergy, an employee or volunteer of the
Archdiocese of Seattle is urged to call the
archdiocesan hotline at 1-800-446-7762.</p>

Dear Friends,<p>In light of the front-page story in the Seattle
Times this past Wednesday, many have asked about
how settlement payments are made for clergy
sexual abuse cases in the Archdiocese of Seattle.</p>
<p>According to information furnished by the
Archdiocese, since the late 1980’s, some $100
million has been paid out in settlements for
approximately 440 claims of sexual abuse of
minors. Shocking as this is, it is important to note
that all of these settlements involve incidents dating
from 30 to 60 years ago. Settlements that were
made directly with survivors, as well as those
resulting from litigation, are included in this
number.</p>
<p>The question arises as to where the money
came for the settlements. These payments have
come from insurance carriers, the archdiocese’s self
-insurance plan, and the sale of archdiocesan-held
property. The only sense in which parish assets are
involved is that we, along with other parishes and
Catholic institutions, pay an annual Archdiocesan
assessment out of which the insurance premiums
are paid.</p>
<p>I know it must seem that this scandal and the
fallout from it will never end. I know I feel that
way. But I am also prayerfully hopeful that we are
moving toward the light of day and that these
settlements will bring a modicum of peace and
closure to the victims and their families.</p>

<p><b>HOW TO SUPPORT A FRIEND THROUGH SUICIDE
LOSS</b>. Marny Lombard of Forefront Suicide Prevention
at the UW will share her experience in learning how to
live with the grief of a suicide loss and ways you can
support a friend who has suffered a suicide loss. She
will also discuss warning signs and how to help.

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Eat less meat: Meat isn’t cheap, and it’s not great for
the environment, either. 70% of the Amazon rainforest
has been destroyed to raise cows, and meat production
results in more carbon emissions than any other
protein. Learning to cook a few choice vegetarian
meals will save money, add variety to your palate, and
give the planet a helping hand.</p>
