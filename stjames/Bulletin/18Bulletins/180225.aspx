our senior parishioners! Right now we have a need for several drivers, each to 
cover one Sunday a month. Openings are currently on the third, fourth, and fifth 
Sundays. All training provided; background check required. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b> for helping some
residents of our parish pay rents that escalate faster
than their income. In last week’s bulletin, we reported
that in the past 12 months we helped more than 900
people. That included helping over 500 people with
rent – many at serious risk of eviction. Out of every
dollar you give us, we now spend over 70 cents just on
rent. A few years ago, rents we typically helped with
were seldom above $800 a month. Now we regularly
see rents of $1200 to $1800 monthly, and more people
who used to be called “middle class” are turning to
SVdP for emergency assistance. Plus, we continue to
help low or no income individuals and families who
struggle to pay much lower rents in subsidized
housing. Whether you donate online or in the special
collection the ushers (thank you, ushers!) take for
SVdP, most of your dollars help keep roofs over the heads of hundreds of our 
neighbors every year – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Refresh your memory regarding which items your city
or town allows for curbside recycling. Start adding
items to your bin that you normally haven’t recycled.
Remind your family, friends and coworkers to recycle.</p>
<p><b>FIRST FRIDAYS ECUMENICAL SMALL GROUP</b>. On the
first Friday of each month, 7:00pm, Fireside Room,
Pastoral Outreach Center. Join other Christians, both
Catholic and non-Catholic for an informal faithsharing
discussion time after the monthly ecumenical
Taizé prayer service. The topic varies each month and
no advanced knowledge or experience is necessary.
This is a great way to get to know fellow Christians as
well as grow in your own faith. Note: We will still
meet on March 2, even though there is no Taizé
service in March. <i>Information</i>,

Wednesday Simple Supper.</p>
