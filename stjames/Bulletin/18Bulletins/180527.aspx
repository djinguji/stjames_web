<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<b>FOR YOUR SAFETY</b>. At each of the weekend Masses a Seattle police officer 
is present on the Cathedral campus. </td></tr></table>
<p><b>ON THE COVER</b> Icon of the Most Holy Trinity. Joan

<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are the gift of Holy Names
Academy in honor of the Class of 2018. Flowers at the
North Transept shrine of the Blessed Virgin Mary are
from Gary and Donna Merlino in memory of their son
Gregg on the first anniversary of his death.</p>
<p><b>LEARN ABOUT LITURGICAL MINISTRIES</b>. Have you ever
thought about volunteering for a liturgical ministry at St.
James? There are many ways to get involved—as usher,
reader, altar server, or Extraordinary Minister of Holy
Communion. Come to the Chapel after Mass TODAY to
learn more about these wonderful ways to get more
involved.</p>
<p><b>NEW ASSISTED LISTENING SYSTEM</b>. Last week a new
listening system was installed in the Cathedral. The old
listening devices no longer work. If you would like to
borrow a listening device, please ask an usher. If you
use a device every week and would like to purchase one
of your own, please contact
<a href="mailto:claughlin@stjames-cathedral.org?subject=Assisted listening system">Corinna Laughlin</a>,
206-264-2086.</p>
<p><b>LOURDES WATER</b>. Members of the Order of Malta will
be here after the Saturday 5:30pm and Sunday 8:00am
and 10:00am Masses to share vials of Lourdes water
which they have brought back from their recent
pilgrimage to Lourdes, France. Lourdes water flows
from the spring which was pointed out to St. Bernadette
in one of the apparitions of Mary at Lourdes in 1851. It
is normal water, not holy water, and may be drunk or
used as a bath. This water has been associated with
countless healings over the years, but, in the words of
St. Bernadette, “you have to keep the faith and pray: this
water couldn't do anything without faith!”</p>
<p><b>MEMORIAL DAY</b>. Monday, May 28 is Memorial Day.
There will be one Mass in the Cathedral at 9:00am. The
Cathedral will remain open for prayer until 4:00pm. The
Parish Office will be closed.</p>
<p><b>MEDIEVAL WOMEN’S CHOIR – SAINTS AND SINNERS
CONCERT</b>. Saturday, June 2 at 8:00pm. Beginning in
the tenth century, the Christian church began to
recognize particularly holy persons as saints, and by
the end of the middle ages, the list of the canonized
was extensive. Many saints were felt to have a special
relationship to a certain group of believers, and were
called upon to intercede with God on their behalf.
Songs praising saints and recounting their good works
were common throughout the middle ages. Join the
Medieval Women's Choir’s musical journey through
the pantheon of medieval saints. <i>Information and
passes</i>, <a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.medievalwomenschoir.org">www.medievalwomenschoir.org</a>.</p>
<p><b>ACCELERATOR HOST HOME PROGRAM</b>. On any given
night in King County, over 1,200 youth and young
adults experience homelessness. Do you have a spare
bedroom and want to make a difference? Caring adults
are needed to open their home to young adults at risk
of homelessness. To learn more, attend an information
session presented by the YMCA on Tuesday, June 12,
6:30pm-7:30pm in the Pastoral Outreach Center.

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A woman who has long dealt with major 
health and financial issues asked us for rent help to avoid eviction. While 
visiting with us in her tiny one-room apartment, she told us that her faith is 
“what gets me through” – faith plus her love of music, especially recording her 
own gospel songs. At our request, she played a recording of one of her songs, 
written for her family in response to several back-to-back, tragic deaths they 
experienced. She sang not of tragedy but of God’s great glory, “more glorious 
than you can dream.” Hearing the passion, pain and beauty in her song, we felt 
like we glimpsed her soul, and it was glorious. Your donations help keep a roof 
over the heads of many beautiful souls in our parish – thank you!
