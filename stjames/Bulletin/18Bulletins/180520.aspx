<p><b>MARY, MOTHER OF THE CHURCH</b>. Pope Francis has
instituted a new memorial to honor the Blessed Virgin
Mary as Mother of the Church on the Monday after
Pentecost. Mary was officially given this title by Pope
Paul VI at the conclusion of the Third Session of the
Second Vatican Council, declaring her to be “Mother of
the Church, that is to say of all Christian people, the
faithful as well as the pastors… the Mother of God
should be honored and invoked by the entire Christian
people by this tenderest of titles.” This new memorial
will be observed for the first time at all Masses on
Monday, May 21.</p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
middle-aged man who needed rent help because he
missed work while recovering from an injury. As we
wrote out a SVdP rent voucher, we mentioned that the money to fund the voucher 
came from donations by parishioners at St James Cathedral. He perked up and said 
he had been thinking about &quot;trying church again&quot; after a long time away. We gave 
him a recent Sunday bulletin, pointed out mass times and assured him he would be 
welcome. He smiled as he looked through the bulletin and said he would &quot;give it 
a try&quot; soon. Thank you for helping us bring the St James spirit into hundreds of 
homes every year!

called upon to intercede with God on their behalf.
Songs praising saints and recounting their good works
were common throughout the middle ages. Join the
