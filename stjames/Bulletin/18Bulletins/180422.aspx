	<p><b>HELP FOR SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING</b>.
Do you know anyone who has a room, Mother-in-Law
apartment, sublet, or Airbnb they would agree to
temporarily rent to survivors of domestic violence and/or human trafficking? It is a significant struggle to find
temporary, transitional, or permanent housing for these
folks, especially for men. One of our partner agencies
is supporting them financially and with other services
while they wait for their work permits. <i>Information</i>:

the Blessed Virgin Mary today, write your petition on
the form provided, and drop it in the box of intentions.</p>
<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
“In the family we first learn how to show love and
respect for life; we are taught the proper use of things,
order and cleanliness, respect for the local ecosystem
and care for all creatures… In the family we learn to
ask without demanding, to say ‘thank you’ as an
expression of genuine gratitude for what we have been
given, to control our aggressivity and greed, and to ask
forgiveness when we have caused harm. These simple
gestures of heartfelt courtesy help to create a culture of
shared life and respect for our surroundings.” (<i>Laudato
Si’</i>, 213)</p>
<p><b>DEADLINE FOR CATHOLIC SCHOOL SCHOLARSHIPS</b>.
