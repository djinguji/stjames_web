<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
One healthy home cleaning habit ensures that new air
comes in regularly. Open the windows from time to
time or run any installed exhaust fans. In cold weather,
the most efficient way to exchange room air is to open
windows and doors and let fresh air in quickly for
about 5 minutes. The furnishings in the room, and the
walls, act as ‘heat sinks’, and by exchanging air
quickly, this heat is retained.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A middle-aged bus passenger stopped a 
larger man from attacking the bus driver. Then the attacker pulled the passenger 
off the bus and beat him severely. Unable to work due to the injuries, the man 
was laid off his job until a doctor clears him to return to work. Despite 
applying all his savings toward his rent, he needed help to avoid eviction. With 
your support, we paid enough to keep this hero housed until he gets his next 
paycheck – thank you! <i>Information</i>,
