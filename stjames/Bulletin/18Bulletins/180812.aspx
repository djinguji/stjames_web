<p><b>MINISTRY OF PRESENCE IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>.
Each weekday in the Cathedral, a volunteer sits at
a desk in the northeast corner of the Cathedral
near the Mary Shrine, available to answer
questions, accept prayer requests, and greet
visitors who stop in between 1:00pm-4:00pm. It’s
a quiet time to pray, read, and be present to those
who come to the Cathedral, often people in need.
<b>We have immediate need for volunteers on
weekdays, especially Tuesdays and
Wednesdays</b>. If you’d some quiet time in the
Cathedral, we’d love to have you be a part of this
ministry. <i>Information</i>,

Maria Laughlin</a>, 206-382-4284.</p>
		<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN NEEDS A FEW MORE
VOLUNTEERS</b> to help with cooking, preparing and
serving our meals. We also need a few more
substitute gleaners to help when our other gleaners
are away. Gleaners go out in the morning, once a
week, usually as partners, to four local
supermarkets and collect food (fruits, vegetables,
milk, deli items, etc.) These items may be used for
our daily meals or passed on to St. Mary’s Food
Bank. It’s a fun and rewarding outreach!

		<p><b>SING WITH CATHEDRAL CHOIR OR WOMEN’S SCHOLA</b>. Have you been 
considering answering the call to serve in the music ministry at St. James? 
Now’s your chance! Music Director Joseph Adam will be holding auditions over the 
summer for membership in the Cathedral Choir (Thursday night rehearsals, sing at 
10:00am Mass) and the Women of St. James Schola (meet at 4:00pm on Sundays to 
sing for 5:30pm Mass). For more information about the required commitment of 
these ensembles and to schedule an audition, contact Marjorie at

		<p><b>WINTER SHELTER DONATIONS</b>. If you are travelling this
summer, consider bringing home the toiletries that are
provided in your hotel rooms. Bring them to Coffee
Hour or to the Parish Office so that they can be used by
the men who stay at the Winter Shelter. Not only are you
keeping a few more plastics out of the garbage, but you
are sharing valuable hygiene products with our overnight
guests. Thank you!</p>
		<p><b>SANDWICH MAKERS NEEDED</b>. The St. Martin de Porres Shelter 
		Outreach Ministry needs a few extra volunteers to make sandwiches for

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
woman who needed rent help. Working as a supervisor
full-time but at a minimum hourly rate, she had been
told by her manager six months before that she was
getting a raise “effective immediately.” The raise never
showed up. When asked about it, the manager seemed
to stall and had no good explanation. Then it was
announced that the company had been bought by
another company, where the woman previously
worked. Knowing the new owners, she gave up hoping
for her promised raise. We were sorry to hear this story
of broken promises, but – with your help – were glad to
assist with rent. Thank you! Information, Bob Clifford
at 206-718-4158 or bobclifford53@gmail.com</p>
<p><b>YOUNG ADULT THIRD SUNDAY SOCIAL</b>. Join other
Catholics in their 20s and 30s next Sunday, August 19,

Courtyard across from the bookstore. Bring a friend to
Mass next Sunday evening and then join us for
refreshments and appetizers. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
“There is a nobility in the duty to care for creation
through little daily actions, and it is wonderful how
education can bring about real changes in lifestyle.
Education in environmental responsibility can
encourage ways of acting which directly and
significantly affect the world around us...” (Pope
Francis, <i>Laudato Si</i>’, 211)</p>
<p><b><i>LAUDATO SI</i>’: A MASS CELEBRATING THE SEASON
OF CREATION</b>. On Saturday, September 22, at 10:30am,
join with Christians worldwide to mark the Season of
Creation, to celebrate the joy which the Earth shares
with us. Father Ryan will preside. All are welcome.</p>
<p><b>A WELCOME AND A FAREWELL AT THE SOLANUS
CASEY CENTER</b>. The Solanus Casey Center, a program

James Cathedral, has hired Corin Brown as Program
Manager. Corin shares years of experience working
with CCS at Noel House, which serves women
experiencing homelessness. We welcome her and look
forward to sharing this ministry of presence together.
