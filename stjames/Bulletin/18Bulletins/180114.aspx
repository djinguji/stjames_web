<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a middle-aged, disabled 
couple who had lived in a local “tent city” for two years, until authorities 
cleared out the location. Good news was that the couple qualified for and moved 
into a rent-subsidized apartment in a new building in our parish. They thought 
their combined disability income would be enough to pay all expenses. Bad news 
was the first utilities bill they received. The bill did not arrive until months 
after they moved in and was hundreds of dollars more than they expected. We 
provided just enough help to get their finances back on track, relieving them of 
much stress and worry. Your support made that possible – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

difficult circumstances. St. James Cathedral is the first parish to launch 
PREPARES in central Seattle. We are forming teams of volunteers to work with a 
parent or family over the long haul. The model is similar to our existing AIDS 
Care Teams. Although PREPARES is brand new, we already have a waiting list of 
pregnant mothers, single parents, and young families who have asked for help. 
PREPARES is the ideal ministry for people who want to live out their commitment 
to social and economic justice and their belief in the dignity of every human 
life. Please consider stepping forward.
