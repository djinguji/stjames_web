	<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I want to share with you the news that, for personal and
family reasons, our Director of Music, Dr. Paul Thornock, has
made the decision to step aside from his important
responsibilities here at the Cathedral. During the too-short time
he has been with us, Paul has done an amazing job. I don’t need
to tell you how beautifully the Cathedral Choir of St. James and
the Women of St. James Schola have been singing under his
gifted direction. Paul has also graced many a liturgy with his
impressive skills as organist and accompanist. Our young
people’s choirs under the direction of Stacey Sunde have also
prospered with Paul’s unfailing support.</p>
<p>I know you will want to join me in expressing gratitude to
Paul for a job well done and in wishing him and his family every
blessing now and in the days ahead.</p>
<p>I am grateful to the staff of the music department, Joseph
Adam, Stacey Sunde, and Marjorie Bunday, for the leadership
they will be giving as we go forward. Your prayerful support
will mean a lot to them—and to me.</p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Father Ryan’s homily on Epiphany Sunday 
spoke of the “stars” we have to guide us, including “the poor, the overlooked” 
who light the way for us along Christ's path of “humility, meekness, patience, 
poverty of spirit, love.” Three days later, we visited a young man with all 
those qualities. He spoke softly of how he had learned to “survive” while 
homeless in the past and, now facing eviction that likely cannot be avoided, is 
willing to live without shelter himself if someone “who needs it more” can get a 
bed in a warm, dry place. As he graciously thanked us for the financial help we 
gave and for taking time to listen, he told us he is Muslim. We were not 
expecting that, but getting to see a shining star up close is, of course, always 
a surprise. Your support helps so many in our parish – thank you! <i>Information</i>,
