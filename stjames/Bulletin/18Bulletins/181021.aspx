important collection are in the pews this weekend.</p>
<p><b>PACIFIC MUSICWORKS CONCERT – MONTEVERDI

Published 30 years after his Vespers, Claudio
Monteverdi’s last great collection of church music, <i>Selva Morale</i>, was conceived and written for the

<p><b>SOLEMN MASS FOR THE FEAST OF ALL SOULS–MOZART REQUIEM</b> Friday, November 2 at 7:30pm. Each
year, St. James Cathedral commemorates the Feast of All
Souls with a solemn Mass for the dead featuring a
musical setting of the Requiem Mass. This year, Joseph
Adam conducts the Cathedral Choir, soloists, and
Cathedral Chamber Orchestra in Mozart’s Requiem.
Experiencing Mozart’s masterpiece within the context of
the Mass for which it was written offers new insights
into a beloved musical work. Very Reverend Michael G.
Ryan, presider. All are welcome.</p>
<p><b>MULTICULTURAL CELEBRATION OF ALL OUR SAINTS</b>.
On Saturday, November 3 at 11:00am, Archbishop Sartain will celebrate Mass with communities from
across the Archdiocese of Seattle, as we honor our
diversity and the saints who guide us along the way.
The Mass will be preceded by Exposition of the
Blessed Sacrament at 10:00am; a reception will
follow. All are welcome!</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A young woman
asked us for a bed. When we visited, we saw she
already had a good twin bed, covered with a sweet
collection of stuffed animals from her childhood. We
gently asked why she needed another bed. She
explained that the bed she had did not belong to her.
Her favorite auntie had loaned her the bed, which
belonged to auntie’s young son. But the boy badly
needed to get his bed back as sharing a bed with his
mom was not working out so well for either of them!
We gladly provided a new twin bed for the young
woman. Thanks to your support, the single bed we
gave is helping three people sleep much better now –
all in their own beds. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>CALLED TO SERVE AS CHRIST CAMPAIGN</b>.
Archbishop Sartain has launched a major capital campaign to raise funds for the 
retirement needs of priests and women religious throughout the Archdiocese of 
Seattle. The Cathedral’s goal is $3.2 million. 15% of every gift will be 
returned to the Cathedral parish. Many thanks to those who have already turned 
in your pledges. We are well on our way to meeting our goal! If you have any 
questions at all, would like additional information, or have other feedback 
about the campaign, don’t hesitate to call or e-mail. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Insulating your attic is very important for keeping your
home warm. As heat rises, a well-insulated attic will
help trap the heat and keep it from escaping. Insulation
can be done by the homeowner fairly easily; however,
if you aren’t sure which type to purchase, or simply
don’t have the time, be sure to call a professional.

<p><b>WINTER SHELTER</b>. You can support our ministry to
homeless men by donating much-needed supplies.
Items can be brought to Sunday Coffee Hour or you
can deliver or ship orders to the Parish Office. Wish
List: hotel-size soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion;
lip balm; toothpaste and men’s toothbrushes. Thank
you!</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN BECOMING CATHOLIC?</b> If you are an adult who has 
never been baptized, an adult who has been baptized in another Christian 
tradition or a Catholic who has been baptized, but not received First Eucharist 
or Confirmation, you are invited to participate in the RCIA, a process of 
initiation into the Catholic Church. You can learn more by going to the
<a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/rcia/default.aspx">RCIA website</a>. <i>

<p><b>CD OF SUNDAY MASS</b>. Do you know someone who is
unable to attend Sunday Mass but would appreciate
staying connected by listening to the Mass on CD?
Each Sunday, a faithful volunteer records and masters
the 10:00am Mass, including the music, prayers,
reading, and homilies. This CD is mailed at no charge
to homebound parishioners and to “long-distance”
parishioners around the country, along with a Sunday
bulletin. If you or someone you know would like to be
added to the list, contact

<p><b>BAPTISM OF INFANTS & YOUNG CHILDREN</b> (under the
age of 7) is celebrated monthly at one of the weekend
Masses. To prepare for this most important sacrament,
parents and godparents participate in a series of classes
to update their understanding of baptism, to reflect on
their responsibility to guide their children in the
practice of the faith, and to learn about the many ways
our parish supports families. Please allow at least two
months for preparation. <i>Information</i>,

Masses in the Mother Cabrini Room located on the

is also offered during baptism preparation classes and
special events. You are welcome to visit our

<p><b>MINISTRY OF PRESENCE IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>. Each
weekday in the Cathedral, a volunteer sits at a desk in
the northeast corner of the Cathedral near the Mary
Shrine, available to answer questions, accept prayer
requests, and greet visitors who stop in between
1:00pm-4:00pm. It’s a quiet time to pray, read, and be
present to those who come to the Cathedral, often
people in need. <b>We are currently looking for a
volunteer who might cover one Tuesday afternoon
each month, beginning in November</b>. If you’d enjoy
some quiet time in the Cathedral, we’d love to have
you be a part of this ministry. <i>Information</i>,
