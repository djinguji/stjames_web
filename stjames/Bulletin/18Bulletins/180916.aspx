Archbishop Sartain on Saturday, October 6 at 10:00am

the legal profession is a tradition going back to the 13th
century. Called the “Red Mass” because of the color of
the vestments worn, this is a time to pray that the Holy
Spirit will inspire all lawyers, judges, government
officials, law school professors, and the entire legal
community to seek truth and justice with integrity. All
are welcome.</p>

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
“Let us ask the Lord and all those engaged in the noble
service of politics that the more sensitive questions of
our day, such as those linked to movements of
migration, climate change and the right of everyone to
enjoy primary goods, may be faced with generous and
farsighted responsibility and in a spirit of cooperation,
especially among those countries most able to help.”
from Pope Francis’ message on the World Day of
Prayer for the Care of Creation.</p>

		<p>If you have looked at the Cathedral towers in
the last couple of weeks, you may have noticed
some scaffolding hanging down from the upper
levels. And, if you look today and compare the
north and south towers you will notice a
significantly cleaner and brighter look on the north
tower terra cotta.</p>
<p>We are in the process of finishing up a two-year
program of refurbishment and repair of the
upper levels of the towers. This has involved
extensive masonry and terra cotta work,
waterproofing, and applying a special water proof
paint. As you might imagine, the upkeep of an
historic 111-year-old building does not come
cheap! Last year’s phase came to about $140,000
and this year’s will be about $155,000.</p>
<p>It’s thanks to your generosity that we have
been able to complete this important work. A
special thanks to all who contributed to this year’s
Annual Catholic Appeal. The parish rebate (which
ended up totalling $173,172!) is covering most of
the costs of the work.</p>

<p><b>SEPTEMBER IS SUICIDE PREVENTION MONTH</b>. Did
you know these facts about ...?</p>
<ul>
	<li>20% of youth ages 13-18 live with a mental health
condition</li>
<li>50% of all lifetime cases of mental illness begin by
age 14 and 75% by age 24</li>

<p><b>SUPPORTING MARRIAGES</b>. Did you know the Catholic
Church really cares about your marriage and wants it
to succeed? And did you know that St. James
Cathedral parish is committed to helping married
couples live out their vocation? Good marriages can
always be made better! Pope Francis described
marriage as “a project to be worked on together” and a
“process of growth” (<i>Amoris Laetitia</i>, no. 218, 221).
We know that a good number of our couples are
without the support of extended family because they
are ‘transplants’ to the Seattle area. All the more
reason for our parish to offer opportunities to connect
with others who are in the same boat and to build
community in the process!</p>
