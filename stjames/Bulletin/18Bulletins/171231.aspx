<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A man called the SVdP Helpline 
(206-767-6449) asking if we could pay his entire month's rent, which was only 
$59 thanks to a low-income rent subsidy. He had given a friend cash to buy a 
money order to pay the rent. The friend disappeared with the cash, so he could 
not pay the rent. We covered the rent and had a delightful visit with the man 
and his pet, an affectionate terrier given to him by another friend who is 
homeless and can no longer care for the dog. As we talked, we realized the man 
was very short on food for himself and his little companion. When we gave him a 
grocery store gift card, he was so happy and grateful, not just for the food but 
also for the gift of hope our visit gave him. Thank you for making this 
possible! <i>Information</i>,
