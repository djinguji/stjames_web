<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Often when we visit
residents of our parish who need a little financial help,
we encounter sadness, even tragedy. But sometimes we
find joy, even laughter – like the man who asked us late
last fall if he could spend part of the grocery store gift
card we gave him to buy a corned beef brisket. We
smiled and said, “Sure!” He grinned as big as his face
would allow and said, “Then I’m going to start
celebrating St Patrick’s Day right now!” Thank you for
your donations, which make any day a holiday for those
we help. <i>Information</i>,
<a href="mailto:bobclifford53@gmail.com?subject=St. Vincent de Paul">Bob 
Clifford</a> at 206-718-4158,</p>
<p><b>CRS RICE BOWL UPDATE</b>. Thank you for participating
in the Catholic Relief Services Rice Bowl program
through prayer, fasting, learning and giving this past
Lent. Parishioners of St. James Cathedral donated an
amazing $23,981.67 (a 37% increase from last year).
Seventy-five percent of the alms will support
humanitarian aid projects that bring vital hope and life-saving
aid to the poorest of the poor overseas. Visit www.crs.org to learn how our gifts are put to use around
the world. Twenty-five percent will stay here in our
archdiocese to help fund hunger and poverty alleviation
programs that assist people in our own local
communities, including our own Cathedral Kitchen
Garden!</p>

<p><b>MINISTRY OF PRESENCE IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>.
Each weekday in the Cathedral, a volunteer sits at
a desk in the northeast corner of the Cathedral
near the Mary Shrine, available to answer
questions, accept prayer requests, and greet
visitors who stop in between 1:00pm-4:00pm. It’s
a quiet time to pray, read, and be present to those
who come to the Cathedral, often people in need.
<b>We have immediate need for volunteers on
weekdays, especially Tuesdays and
Wednesdays</b>. If you’d some quiet time in the
Cathedral, we’d love to have you be a part of this
ministry. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Make it a priority to increase your use of public
transportation. Buses and light rail are operating
anyway, so making use of them instead of your car—even just two or three times a month—is a step in
reducing emissions and congestion. You might find it
easy enough to do even more often.</p>
<p><b><i>LAUDATO SI</i>’: A MASS CELEBRATING THE SEASON
OF CREATION</b>. On Saturday, September 22, at 10:30am,
join with Christians worldwide to mark the Season of
Creation, to celebrate the joy which the Earth shares
with us. Father Ryan will preside. After Mass, he will bless the new Cathedral 
Garden. All are welcome.</p>

GENERAL MEETING</b>. Mark your calendars to learn
more about the current state of affordable housing and
homelessness in King County. A panel discussion
including staff from Catholic Housing Services and
Muslim Housing Services will be moderated by
Michael Ramos of the Church Council of Greater
Seattle. Thursday, September 27, 7:00pm in Cathedral
Hall.</p>
<p><b>DO YOU WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES
OF REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS?</b> Join our new group
of Immigration Champions. Together we will pray,
learn, and take action to make a difference locally,
nationally, and around the world. We will gain a
deeper grounding in what our faith calls us to do,
develop an understanding of the complexity of
migration and immigration, and work together to make
a difference. Our first meeting will be on Tuesday,
September 11 at 6:30 in the Pastoral Outreach Center.

our parish supports families. Please allow at least two
