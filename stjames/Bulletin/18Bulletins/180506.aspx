<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Mom and
grandma were the most important people in the life of
a young man we visited recently. He had barely moved
into his first apartment when news came that grandma
had died back home – 2,000 miles away. The rent
money he had saved covered his plane fare for the
funeral. When he returned, an eviction notice was
taped to his door. With your help, we paid enough rent
to stop the eviction and gave this loving grandson an SVdP thrift store voucher to buy a few essential
household items for his new home. Thank you!

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
When shopping, often you can choose to have a receipt
emailed to you instead of receiving a printed copy.
Digital receipts are easier to organize, save and search,
and they reduce paper waste.</p>

<p><b>MAY IS MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH</b>. Many
people believe that mental illness is a moral or
spiritual failure, even caused by demonic possession. It
has only been in the last 40 years that medical science

<ul>
	<li>One in four persons sitting in our pews has a
family member struggling with mental health
issues.</li>
<li>Serious depression affects 1 in 50 children. Only
1/3 receive treatment.</li>

age, gender, economic status or ethnicity.</li>
