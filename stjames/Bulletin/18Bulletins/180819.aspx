<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>No one who has been following the findings of the Pennsylvania grand jury
regarding clergy sexual abuse and official cover-ups—not to mention the revelations
about the former Cardinal Archbishop of Washington, D.C.—can be anything but
horrified. So disturbing were the findings and revelations that I considered devoting
the homily to the subject this weekend. I thought better of it after reading the
scriptures. Their message—which we need to hear—is not even remotely connected to
the devastating story that grabbed the headlines this past week. So, instead of using
the pulpit, I decided to write to you, hoping that I might bring you—if not
understanding—at least some clarity and a word of comfort. Little did I realize how
difficult that would be.</p>
<p>To my way of thinking, the entire issue of abuse on the part of clergy (including
highly placed members of the hierarchy) and the callous cover-up that many bishops
have been guilty of, defies understanding. We all understand human weakness and
human sinfulness, of course. That is a given. But when the sins are committed by
people whose very calling in life puts them in privileged positions of trust—and who,
in betraying that trust, not only wound and scar their victims for a lifetime, causing
them to lose faith in themselves, in God, in the church and everything it stands for—
well then, any attempt at explanation fails.</p>
<p>And when these crimes are compounded by church leaders hiding the truth,
favoring perpetrators over victims, and caring more for the Institution, its reputation
and its assets, than for the helpless victims, then a heinous offense comes close to
being unforgiveable.</p>
<p>But we know all this. We have been forced to deal with it for the past two
decades and more, and we are weary of it—weary beyond words. And we are angry,
too, and scandalized and, let’s be honest: we are also ashamed. I know I am. How
could this happen in the church we love? And how can we still hold our heads high
and continue to own our Catholic faith?</p>
<p>More than fifteen years ago at what one might have hoped was the nadir of this
long nightmare, I remember how difficult I found it to appear in public wearing my
clerical collar. The present moment of renewed revelations isn’t much different. But
this is not about me and my feelings. I am sure many of you find yourselves at a loss
for words as you interact with family members, friends, neighbors, and co-workers,
many of whom are not Catholic and who are appalled and simply don’t get it. I wish I
had words to reassure you, words you could use to reassure them. I do not. And I
wish I could take away the sense of powerlessness that comes from the fact that the
channels open to you for speaking out and effecting change in the Church are few. I
cannot.</p>
<p>And I take no comfort in knowing that this is a societal problem that occurs
most often in families—that the church has no corner on these crimes or their cover
up. There is no comfort there. The church should be held to a higher standard. Nor is
there any comfort to be found in the fact that these recent revelations come from
across the country. Geography has nothing to do with this, although we can be
grateful that our own Archdiocese, back in the mid-1980s, was one of the first in the
country to understand the gravity of the situation and to take steps to address it.</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, the only comfort I can find in this situation is my belief
that this is God’s church and that God can use this terrible tragedy not only to awaken
the church to its sins, but also to force it to deal with the underlying causes of those
sins. Nothing short of a thorough, searingly honest and completely transparent
examination of conscience and admission of guilt will do. And no laws, canons, or
traditions, no matter how sacrosanct, should escape critical examination and review.
We must find out how this has been allowed to happen and we must face the truth
and not hide from it, no matter the cost. And then we must repent and reform. I know
this is the commitment of our Archbishop and it must be ours as well.</p>
<p>Dear friends in Christ, with every fiber of my being I believe that the church is
the Body of Christ, and I know that God will see us through this nightmare. But that is
no excuse for complacency. We have our work cut out for us. As we refuse to tolerate
any further cover ups or dishonesty on the part of Church leaders, we must demand
of ourselves the same faithfulness, honesty, integrity, and courage we demand of
them. And as we do our best, with God’s grace, to survive this dark hour and to learn
from it, we must pray without ceasing for this Church we love, this Church we are.</p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A middle-aged
restaurant waiter lost his job because of one bad
review on a popular website. He was one of only two
waiters who were overwhelmed when assigned to
cover a party attended by 200 young professionals, a
few of whom turned rowdy. One attendee later
complained on the website about the service and said
the waiter had a “bad attitude.” Despite the waiter’s
otherwise excellent work history, his employer
apologized and said he had to let the waiter go because
the restaurant world is so competitive that they could
not afford “a single bad review.” When we met the
unemployed waiter, his income was only $182 in
monthly foodstamps. With your support, we helped
pay his rent and referred him to another charity for
more help. Thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
“One particularly serious problem is the quality of
water available to the poor. . . . Even as the quality of
available water is constantly diminishing, in some
places there is a growing tendency, despite its scarcity,
to privatize this resource, turning it into a commodity
subject to the laws of the market. Yet access to safe
drinkable water is a basic and universal human right,
since it is essential to human survival and, as such, is a
condition for the exercise of other human rights. Our
world has a grave social debt towards the poor who
lack access to drinking water, because they are denied
the right to a life consistent with their inalienable
dignity.” (Pope Francis, <i>Laudato Si</i>’, 29-30)</p>

<p><b>MINISTRY OF PRESENCE IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>.
Each weekday in the Cathedral, a volunteer sits at
a desk in the northeast corner of the Cathedral
near the Mary Shrine, available to answer
questions, accept prayer requests, and greet
visitors who stop in between 1:00pm-4:00pm. It’s
a quiet time to pray, read, and be present to those
who come to the Cathedral, often people in need.
<b>We have immediate need for volunteers on
weekdays, especially Tuesdays and
Wednesdays</b>. If you’d some quiet time in the
Cathedral, we’d love to have you be a part of this
ministry. <i>Information</i>,

		<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN NEEDS A FEW MORE
VOLUNTEERS</b> to help with cooking, preparing and
serving our meals. We also need a few more
substitute gleaners to help when our other gleaners
are away. Gleaners go out in the morning, once a
week, usually as partners, to four local
supermarkets and collect food (fruits, vegetables,
milk, deli items, etc.) These items may be used for
our daily meals or passed on to St. Mary’s Food
Bank. It’s a fun and rewarding outreach!
