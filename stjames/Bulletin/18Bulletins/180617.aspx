<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A young, single
dad had to put his 2-year-old daughter into daycare
because grandma had to stop babysitting to focus on
caring for grandpa, who had become ill. Putting the
little girl into daycare required dad to stop commuting
to work by bus because the only way he can pick her
up and drop her off at daycare on time is by driving.
Dad loves his job helping homeless families find
housing and rebuild their lives, but his modest
paycheck was strained to the breaking point by
daycare costs and commuting expense. With your
donations, we paid enough rent to avoid eviction,
buying dad time to get back on track financially.
Thank you for helping SVdP help families in need in our parish!

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Pope Francis writes that the disappearance of an entire
culture "can be just as serious, or even more serious,
than the disappearance of a species of plant or animal."
We should strive to listen to indigenous peoples,
protect their lands and involve them in processes and
decisions that affect them.</p>
<p><b>THINKING OF BEING MARRIED AT ST. JAMES
CATHEDRAL?</b> Parishioners are able to schedule a
wedding at St. James Cathedral 14 months in advance;
non- parishioners are able to schedule 12 months in
advance. We do require at least six months preparation
for the Sacrament of Matrimony. <i>Information</i>,

First Eucharist or Confirmation, you are invited to
participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the

Masses. To prepare for this most important sacrament,

their responsibility to guide their children in the
practice of the faith, and to learn about the many ways
our parish supports families. Please allow at least two
months for preparation. <i>Information</i>, Julianna Castro,

<p><b>CRS ASSISTING WITH LOCAL RELIEF EFFORT IN
GUATEMALA</b>. Catholic Relief Services (CRS) is
responding to the “Volcan de Fuego” eruption in
Guatemala, that left 114 dead, and almost 200 missing.
Many families are displaced, and entire communities
are devastated. In collaboration with the Church, and
local authorities, CRS is providing food, water,
medicine and other lifesaving relief items to those
impacted by the disaster. The Church has also opened
three shelters for the displaced, and the number of
people seeking refuge continues to grow. <i>Information</i>,
