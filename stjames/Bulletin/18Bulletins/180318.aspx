O’Dea parking lot to receive your donations of gently
used clothes, shoes, kitchen and other household
goods, books, DVDs, CDs, sports equipment and other
re-sellable items. During Lent last year, dozens of
parishioners sacrificed their time to cull through
personal possessions and decide what they could part
with. The result was a huge haul for SVdP, yielding
countless treasures that were then sold through SVdP’s
five King County thrift shops. Proceeds benefitted our
neighbors in need. Can you help us haul away an even
bigger stash of treasures this year? <i>Information</i>, Ken
