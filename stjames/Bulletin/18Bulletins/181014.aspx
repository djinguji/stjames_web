Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person

more sustainable future. We begin with a vegetarian
supper at 6pm. The film begins at 6:30pm, with

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Most people we
visit need our financial help one time only and never
again. But some we see off and on over the years –
like one elderly woman living downtown who receives
a minimal Social Security check each month but
whose ongoing medical expenses make it hard for her
to keep up with rent. We help when we can and have
had the pleasure of watching her move from a dark,
tiny room where she often felt ill and depressed to a
small, light-filled apartment where she is now healthier
and happier. She welcomes our visits and enjoys our
conversations, as do we. Your support pays bills and
brings joy to many–thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Go nuts! Make the most of nuts in the Autumn by
