<p><b>WELCOME:</b> If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know how welcome
you are &#150; whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city. </p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. Stop by the Cathedral
Bookstore today for a terrific selection of books,
including <i>In Due Season</i>, a brand-new memoir by
Paul Wilkes, who spoke at the Cathedral last summer.
&#8220;<i>In Due Season</i> ranks alongside Merton&#8217;s best
because Wilkes absorbed Merton, then moved
forward with him, and ultimately beyond
him&#8221; (NCR). You can also find a wide selection of
Lenten reading, as well as some great music for Lent
by Cathedral Musicians. Try Dubois&#8217; Seven Last
Words, recorded live at St. James Cathedral, Good
Friday, 2005.</p>
<p><b>EASTER FLOWERS</b>. Your generous offerings will
help to beautify the Cathedral for the coming great
feast of Easter. Envelopes are available in the
pews. Thank you for your generosity.</p>
<p><b>WEBSITE MELTDOWN</b>. On Friday, March 20, the
server hosting our Cathedral website failed, and we
lost a lot of data. The site is up and running again,
but we ask for your patience as we rebuild the pages
that were lost! In the meantime, you can download
the Easter Mass Schedule, read Father Ryan&#8217;s homily
of last Sunday, Pray the Stations of the Cross, and
more! </p>
<p><b>A LENTEN BIBLE STUDY&#8230; ST. PAUL&#8217;S LETTER TO THE ROMANS</b>. Tuesday, 1:00-3:00 or 7:00-9:00,
Cathedral Place, second floor. We complete our two
year review of the writings of St. Paul by studying his
letter to the Romans&#8212;the most compelling and
challenging of all his letters. All are welcome and no
bible experience required! [This Week: The Duties of
Christians, Conclusion (Chapters 12-16)]</p>
<p><b>CHRISM MASS</b>. The annual Chrism Mass will take
place in the Cathedral on Thursday, April 2, at
7:00pm. During this Mass, the Archbishop blesses
the Oil of the Sick and the Oil of Catechumens, and
consecrates the Sacred Chrism. All are
welcome. <i>Because of preparations for the Chrism
Mass, there will be no 5:30pm Mass on Thursday,
April 2</i>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>PALM SUNDAY</b>. Next Sunday, April 5, is Palm Sunday.
The 10:00am Mass will begin with the traditional
procession of palms. Mass will begin at O&#8217;Dea High
School Gym at the corner of Marion Street and Terry
Avenue. The Cathedral will be closed before the Mass;
please come directly to the Gym and participate with
heart and voice in the blessing and the procession of
palms. <i>If you are physically unable to join the
procession, ask an usher for assistance.</i></p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES ESL BOOK CLUB</b>. Join us on Tuesday, March
31 in the Pastoral Outreach Center to discuss <i>Jasmine</i>
by Bharati Mukherjee. Acclaimed by the <i>Los Angeles
Times Book Review</i> as &#8220;artful and arresting&#8221; and
&#8220;breathtaking,&#8221; the book tells the riveting story of a
young woman&#8217;s journey and transformation from rural
India to Iowa. <i>Jasmine</i> is a quick read, and a thought-provoking
story of what it means to be American. Now
available in the Cathedral Bookstore. <i>Information</i>,

<img border="0" src="../images/ElectTree.jpg" width="125" height="128" align="left">This week we celebrate the third and
final Scrutiny with the Gospel story of
the raising of Lazarus. Death is our
greatest fear and this story reminds us
that God&#8217;s power and mercy are
greater than ANY fear, sin or pain that we have in
our lives. The Elect are asked to think about what
needs to die in their lives in order for them to
receive the new life being offered to them in
baptism. For some, the question of whether they
even want to come out of the tomb is important,
whether they are willing to risk coming out into the
light of Christ to see what awaits them. This week
they will also be presented with The Lord&#8217;s Prayer,
which teaches us that God loves as a loving father
and will &#8220;give us &#8230;our daily bread&#8221; and &#8220;lead us
from temptation.&#8221; As they approach these last days
of preparation before baptism, keep them in your
prayers. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO ADOPT ONE

<p><b>WELCOME, PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN</b>. We
support all of our parishioners who are attending Mass
with young children and we welcome those children
into our midst. If you find that your child needs a quiet
place away from the stimulation of the Mass, please feel
free to step into the west vestibule or the cathedral
chapel, where we have provided a sound system so that
you can continue to participate in the Mass. We
appreciate your effort to be with us and to include your
child in our worship. <i>Please note that babysitting is
available in the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral
Outreach Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon

walk in solidarity with our brothers

week of Lent, we focus on Ghana,

support the Quality Education
Improvement Program. The
program provides teachers with
formal training and helps increase community
involvement in schools. In Ghana, most girls still do
not attend school, and most boys have to limit their
school days in order to go to work to help their
families. The educational programs supported by
Operation Rice Bowl are working to improve
education for all children in Ghana. Let us accept
the challenge of Operation Rice Bowl: to pray that
we overcome indifference to the needs of others; to
fast in solidarity with those who are hungry by eating
simply; to learn about the needs of the poor, and to
give money saved by fasting and eating simply to
Operation Rice Bowl.</td>
