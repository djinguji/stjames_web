	<p><b>SANDWICH VOLUNTEERS NEEDED</b>. St. Martin de Porres Shelter has seen an increased need for meals
and St. James is responding by adding a second
night of service to our current Sandwich
Ministry. We need a whole new crew of volunteers
who can help us make 300+ sandwiches for the 4th
Monday of each month. <i>Information</i>, Tara at

	<p><b>HELP A SENIOR IN NEED</b>. Many in our community are in need of help 
	with transportation, shopping, laundry, housework, and more. Age, illness, 
	economics, and disabilities can all be barriers to accomplishing these 
	routine, daily tasks. By volunteering just a few hours a month, you can make 
	a huge difference in someone’s life, provide them peace of mind, and help 
	them to stay in their own home rather than going to an institutionalized 
	setting. If you are interested in joining this rewarding ministry, please 
	come to the orientation on the 2nd floor of the Pastoral Outreach Center on 
	Wednesday, June 10 at 6:30pm. <i>Information</i>
