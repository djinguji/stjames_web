<p align="center"><i>This letter appeared in last week&#146;s bulletin and is reprinted
this week for the benefit of those who were not able to be here</i>.</p>

<p><b>From the Desk of the Pastor</b></p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>

<p>We will remember December of 2008! It was the Advent of the Deep Freeze, the Christmas
of the Great Snow. Never in my memory have we had weather so icy and cold that we had a
nearly empty Cathedral on the last two Sundays of Advent. Christmas was better, but
attendance was only about half of what it has been in past years. For those of you who
were unable to be here, I can well imagine how disappointed you were. Many of you,
I&#146;m sure, watched the Midnight Mass from St. James on television but that&#146;s a
poor substitute for being here in person. Another reminder of what an important part the
community plays in our life and worship&#133;.</p>

<p>Any way you cut it, Seattle is a unique place. Only in Seattle would city officials
take to the airwaves to assure people that the major arterials would be kept open for the
benefit of those going to the football game on December 21 (making it clear that that was
the <i>only</i> reason people should consider going out!). Only in Seattle! Despite that,
a significant number of you did feel safe (and adventurous!) enough to make the trek to
the Cathedral on that Sunday from all over the region. You came from Capitol Hill, Beacon
Hill, and Rainier Valley; from Montlake and Mountlake Terrace, Magnolia and Madison Park;
from North Bend, Newcastle, Preston, Issaquah, Bellevue, Squak Mountain, Federal Way,
Shoreline, Sammamish, and Kenmore, and a whole lot of other places. I was impressed!</p>

<p>And I felt very badly for the hundreds and hundreds of you who couldn&#146;t possibly
get here. Some of you let us know through calls and e-mails how much you missed being with
the community during days when being together, and praying together, and celebrating
together in the Cathedral are the high point of your year.</p>

<p>I would have to confess to you that, for me, those days were an important learning
time. If you know me at all, you know that I kind of like being on top of things and that
I expect things to go as planned! Well, God used those days to teach me a little about my
limits: about resignation, acceptance, and patience, gently reminding me that I
wasn&#146;t in charge (!) and that I ought, therefore, to relax a bit and let go. In a
wonderful way, God turned those days from being the winter of my discontent into the
winter of my discovery. It may not have been a lesson I was thrilled about getting, but I
have no doubt it was one I needed.</p>

<p><i>I know you won&#146;t take offense if I gently remind those of you who were unable
to be here on those Advent Sundays or on Christmas to send in your offering, or put it in
the collection basket next Sunday</i>. As you might expect, dramatically reduced
attendance resulted in drastically reduced collections. The actual shortfall for those two
Advent Sundays and Christmas (compared with last year) was $50,000! As you know, we depend
on every dollar to meet our payroll and program expenses, as well as to maintain the
Cathedral and other parish buildings.</p>

<p>Here&#146;s a closing thought for those of you who weren&#146;t here for Christmas. Go
to our wonderful website and take a look at the beautiful albums of photographs of the
Christmas celebrations. Why, you can even read the Christmas homily if you have the
inclination. And the patience!</p>

<p>Blessings for the New Year for you and your families.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME:</b> If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know how welcome
you are &#150; whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city. </p>

<p><b>FLOWERS</b> in the Cathedral Chapel are from the 50th wedding anniversary
celebration of Donna and Robert Clifford.</p>

<p><b>MAKE-UP SUNDAYS: YOUNG ADULTS &#147;WARM HEARTS AND SOLES&#148;</b> fifth annual

weather had a definite impact &#150; many who would have dropped off socks were unable to.
So, we will continue to collect socks this Sunday and next, January 11 and 18. Drop off
new socks at the Young Adult table in Cathedral Hall after 8:00 am, 10:00 am, and 12:00
Sunday Masses, or during this coming week and next week at 2nd floor Cathedral Place. The
snow might be gone, but the feet are likely to still be cold! <i>Information</i> <a

    <p><b>HELP A SENIOR IN NEED</b>. Many people in our St. James community and beyond are in
    need of help with transportation, shopping, laundry, housework, and more. Age, illness,
    economics, and disabilities can all be barriers to accomplishing these routine daily
    tasks. By volunteering just a few hours a month, you can make a huge difference in
    someone&#146;s life by providing them peace of mind and the option to stay in their own
    home rather than going to an institutionalized setting. If you are interested in joining
    this rewarding ministry, please come to the Orientation to be held in the Pastoral
    Outreach Center on Tuesday, January 27 at 6:30 pm. <i>Information</i> <a
