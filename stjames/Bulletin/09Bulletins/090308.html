<p><b>WELCOME:</b> If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know how welcome
you are &#150; whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city. </p>
<p><b>NEW IN THE BOOKSTORE</b>. Stop by the Cathedral
Bookstore today for a wide variety of Lenten reading,
including daily meditations by Henri Nouwen, Thomas
Merton, G. K. Chesterton, and many more.</p>
<p><b>LENTEN HOLY HOURS</b>. Each Friday during Lent, join
in a special Lenten Holy Hour beginning at 12 Noon.
With Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament, Liturgy of
the Hours, Rosary, and time for silence, Holy Hour is
the perfect Lenten retreat for the end of a busy week.</p>
<p><b>STATIONS OF THE CROSS DURING LENT</b>. There are three opportunities to 
pray the Stations each week: on Mondays following 12:10pm Midday Prayer, 
Wednesdays following the 5:30 pm Mass, and Fridays following the 8:15am Mass 
(except on First Fridays). On Sunday, March 15, following the Noon Mass, the 
children of the Cathedral will pray the Stations with Father Ryan.</p>
<p><b>A LENTEN BIBLE STUDY&#8230;ST. PAUL&#8217;S LETTER TO
THE ROMANS</b>. Tuesdays, 1:00 -3:00pm or 7:00 -
9:00pm, Cathedral Place, second floor. We complete
our two year review of the writings of St. Paul by
studying his letter to the Romans&#8212;the most
compelling and challenging of all his letters. All are
welcome and no bible experience required! (<i>This
Week: Salvation through Faith in Christ</i> &#8212; <i>3:21&#8211;5:21</i>)</p>

in solidarity with our brothers and sisters

with small farmers to improve their farming
techniques, which has resulted in tenfold increases
in production. CRS also works with small farmers on
marketing their produce, and helping successful
farmers teach others. Let us accept the challenge of
Operation Rice Bowl: to pray that we overcome
indifference to the needs of others; to fast in
solidarity with those who are hungry by eating
simply; to learn about the needs of the poor, and to
give money saved by fasting and eating simply to
Operation Rice Bowl.</td>

<img border="0" src="../../images/ElectTree.jpg" width="125" height="128" align="left">Lent is a particularly special time
for the Elect who have been
journeying towards baptism,
Eucharist and confirmation at the
Easter Vigil. As part of their
preparation, the Church
celebrates anointing with the oil
of the Catechumen, blessings and exorcisms.
Beginning next Sunday, we will join in prayer for
our Elect as they participate in the ancient
ceremonies called the Scrutinies that symbolize the
spiritual purification taking place in their lives as
they prepare for baptism. Through these Scrutinies,
blessings and anointings, the Elect are encouraged
to reflect more deeply on their own spiritual
challenges and weaknesses. At the same time, these
rites offer powerful prayers of faith, hope and
strength on their behalf, calling upon God&#8217;s grace
and mercy to penetrate their entire lives. Please
continue to keep them in your prayers.</p>
<p><b>LENTEN PRAYER PARTNERS FOR THE ELECT</b>.
It is not too late to &#8220;adopt&#8221; one of our Elect as they
prepare to celebrate the sacraments of Baptism,
Confirmation and Eucharist. You are asked to pray
everyday for him/her asking for God&#8217;s blessings
and guidance. Also, notes and cards will be
collected during Holy Week to be given to the Elect
before Easter. Prayer cards are available at the
place of prayer located in the north aisle of the west
nave of the Cathedral (where you can also learn
more about each of them in our Book of the Elect),
in the bookstore, and in Cathedral Hall during
Sunday morning hospitality. You can also meet our Elect by going to our
<a href="../../Events/2009/elect2009.htm">parish website</a>. Your prayers
make a difference! <i>Information</i>,
