<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.
</i></p>
<p><b>BUILD HOPE COLLECTION</b>. The Archbishop has asked us
to raise $12,000 for this important collection which will
fund a major local media campaign in Lent, 2010.
Thank you to all who have given so generously to this
important cause. <i><b>A gift of $35 from each of our regular
contributors would allow us to meet our goal</b></i>.</p>
<p><b>CHILDREN’S FAITH FORMATION</b> sessions begin this
Sunday, September 27, 11:00 to 11:50 and will continue
every Sunday thereafter. If you were not able to register
your child, come to the second floor of Cathedral Place;

<p><b>ROSARY FOR LIFE</b>. Each Thursday in October,
beginning this coming Thursday, October 1, the rosary
will be prayed in the Cathedral at 6:00pm (shortly
following the 5:30pm Mass). What better way to begin
the month of October, Respect Life Month, than by
praying the rosary together for a greater respect for all
life, from conception to natural death? The rosary will
be prayed each Thursday evening in October as we
observe Respect Life Month.</p>
<p><b>FIRST FRIDAY</b>. On Friday, October 2, Exposition of the
Blessed Sacrament will begin following the 8:15am
Mass and continue until 1:00pm, with a Holy Hour for
Life beginning at 12:00 Noon, with Liturgy of the
Hours, Rosary, and Benediction of the Blessed
Sacrament. Deacon David Olsen will preside. All are
welcome.</p>
<p><b>JOURNEY THROUGH GRIEF</b>. Are you seeking comfort
after the death of a loved one? Join others who have also
experienced loss in a prayerful supportive environment.
In a six-week guided group process we will journey
through our grief and gently embrace our mourning so
that ultimately we may find healing. <i>Information</i>,
