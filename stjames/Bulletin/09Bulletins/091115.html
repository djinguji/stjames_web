<p>November 15, 2009</p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>If you see a little less of me this weekend than usual, or if you observe that my
gait is a little gimpy (or I’m using crutches or a walker!), don’t feel too sorry for me. I
had some surgery on my legs this past week that will necessitate my wearing “moon
boots” for a couple of weeks and, inevitably, will probably cut down on my activity.
You can imagine how happy that makes me! The surgery is one I’ve been putting off
for years but I finally decided that delaying wasn’t going to improve things. So, I’ll
appreciate a prayer or two for a quick recovery, and I’ll also appreciate your patience
if it takes me a little longer to get from the chair to the pulpit to the altar!</p>
<p>I want to say a big thank you to Anna Horton and David Unger for their
really wonderful presentation on Sacrificial Giving at the Masses last weekend, as
well as to everyone who has turned in a Sacrificial Giving commitment form. And I
would like to say a word of encouragement to those of you who have yet to do so.
This parish depends on the generosity of each of our parishioners and families. I
believe everyone can give something, even if it’s only the prayers you offer for your
parish or the time and talent you share with our many ministries. And when it
comes to your monetary contribution and how much you should give, all I would
say is that it should reflect what God has given you. <b>When you are at peace with
yourself about the amount of your giving and don’t find yourself making an
excuse for it, then you are probably giving at the right level.</b> For some of you, that
would probably be quite a lot because God has blessed you with considerable means
and your gift can help make up for those who have much less. This is a wonderfully
generous parish but, to be honest, too few are supporting too many! Someone asked
me what our “goal” was for this campaign. Our only goal is that everyone in the
parish will participate—everyone! Maybe it’s naïve to think we’ll ever get 100%
participation. But I think you’ll agree St. James Cathedral can do better than the 40%
participation we had last year! Please fill out our commitment card today, even if
you are unable to make a pledge, and save the parish from spending a lot of money
on costly follow-up mailings. Thank you!</p>
<p>During these November days, please continue to remember our deceased
parishioners and friends, especially those whose names are printed on the cover of
the bulletin. Their generous remembrance of the Cathedral in their estate planning
has accounted for a significant part of the parish’s annual income over the years.
Without their generous gifts we wouldn’t be who we are. Do keep them in your
prayers.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.

<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>
are a gift from an
anonymous donor. Flowers at the Sacred Heart shrine
are from the Saturday wedding of Brynne Ann Sack and
Christopher Jackson. Flowers at the North Transept
shrine of the Blessed Virgin Mary are offered in
memory of Lindy Berry, on the 7th anniversary of her
death, from Katherine and Sean Berry.</p>

<p><b>FOUNDATIONS IN FAITH—MORALITY</b>. Using the Bible,
<i>The Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>, and Church
documents, this adult enrichment program will explore
the Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes as the
framework of a moral life, identifying the call to
dignity for each human person and the common good
as two foundations of a moral life. Participants will
look at objective moral truth and the sources of moral
norms in the Church, and explore the Christian virtues
and how they are relevant to moral decision-making.
In addition, they will discuss what is meant by a
“well-formed conscience” and a process for Catholic
moral decision-making as well as the primacy of the
Church’s moral teaching in the life of the believer and
the inviolability of human conscience. Please bring
your Bible and copy of the Catechism to the class. The
class will take place on Sunday, November 22 at St.
Peter’s in Beacon Hill from 1:30-5:30pm. Cost: $5 per
class. (Cosponsored by St. James Cathedral with the
South Seattle Deanery) <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>HELP A SENIOR IN NEED</b>. Many in our community are
in need of help with transportation, shopping, laundry,
housework, and more. Age, illness, economics, and
disabilities can all be barriers to accomplishing these
routine, daily tasks. By volunteering just a few hours a
month, you can make a huge difference in someone’s
life, provide them peace of mind, and help them stay in
their own home rather than going to an institutionalized
setting. If you are interested in joining this rewarding
ministry, please come to the orientation in the Mother
Cabrini Room, Pastoral Outreach Center on Tuesday,
December 1 at 6:30pm. <i>Information</i>

<p>Please drop your 2010 commitment card in the
offering basket today. As David Unger and Anna
Horton reminded us last week: “Whether or not
you actually spend the night on the floor for the
Winter Shelter, you should know that when you
participate in Sacrificial Giving, you are
there. You may not teach a Sunday school class,
or sing in the choir, or drive seniors to an outing,
or clean an oven in a chore ministry, but through
Sacrificial Giving, you are a part of all these
things.”</p>
<p><i>Our goal is not a dollar amount</i>. Instead, we’re
going for 100% parishioner participation. We
have a long way to go!</p>
