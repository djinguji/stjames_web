involvement of the parish community. A new inquiry
session will begin on Wednesday, September 9.

church. The sessions are offered on Mondays,
September 14 through December 7, 7:00-9:00pm on
2nd floor Cathedral Place. Classes are offered without
any obligation. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>FIXING A BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM</b>. The USCCB Justice for Immigrants Campaign calls for
comprehensive immigration reform. But what does this
mean and how can the immigration system be
improved? A recent report on immigrant detention
centers examines the ways in which these centers have
failed to meet minimum standards set by the federal
government. These standards affect detainees’ right to
due process and to challenge their deportation
cases. The report includes suggestions for how the
system might be improved. You can find the link to the
report on <a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/esl/immigration.html">our website</a>.

<p><b>FUNERAL PLANNING</b>. Many people have questions
regarding funerals—questions ranging from the
Church’s position regarding cremation and burial to
how and when funerals are scheduled and celebrated in
the Cathedral. Since the time of the death of a loved
one is likely to be very emotionally draining, it is
clearly not the best time for dealing with such
questions. In an effort to help parishioners be prepared
ahead of time, the Cathedral offers a simple guide, available at our 
<a href="http://www.stjamescathedral.org/funerals">parish website</a>. The booklet may also obtained
by calling the parish office.</p>
<p><b>HEALTH CARE REFORM: WHAT DOES THE CHURCH
SAY?</b> As part of the current debate over health care
reform, the U.S. Bishops are calling for a truly
universal health policy with respect for human life and
dignity, access for all with a special concern for the
poor and inclusion of legal immigrants, pursuing the
common good and preserving pluralism including
freedom of conscience and variety of options, and
restraining costs and applying them equitably across
the spectrum of payers. “In our Catholic tradition,
health care is a basic human right. Access to health
care should not depend on where a person works, how
much a family earns, or where a person lives. Instead,
every person, created in the image and likeness of God,
has a right to life and to those things necessary to
sustain life, including affordable, quality health care.
This teaching is rooted in the biblical call to heal the
sick and to serve ‘the least of these,’ our concern for
human life and dignity, and the principle of the
common good.” Learn more at
<a class="navy" href="http://www.usccb.org/healthcare/">USCCB website</a>. </p>
<p><b>FOUNDATIONS IN FAITH—WHAT DOES THE
CATHOLIC CHURCH BELIEVE AND WHAT
DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IT MY LIFE?</b> What does
the Catholic Church believe and what difference does
it make it my life? Using the Bible, <i>The Catechism of
the Catholic Church</i>, and Church documents, this adult
enrichment program will explore the Catholic
interpretation of scripture, key theological concepts,
and the history of the Church. This is a wonderful
opportunity for an in-depth look at Catholic teaching
and its implications for our everyday lives. Classes
this year include Israel’s Sacred History, Morality,
Christology and Church, Sacraments and Liturgy,
Gospel of John, and Council of Trent/Vatican II. You
can come to one or all classes. Classes take place on
9/20, 10/18, 11/22, 2/21, 3/7, 3/21 and 4/18 at St.
Peter’s in Beacon Hill from 1:30-5:30 PM. Cost: $5
per class. (Cosponsored by St. James Cathedral with
the South Seattle Deanery) <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>.
This week we remember in prayer the parishes of
St. Monica in Mercer Island, St. Augustine in Oak Harbor,
and St. Mary of the Valley in Monroe.</p>
