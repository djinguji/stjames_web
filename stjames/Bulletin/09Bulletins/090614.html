<p><b>From the Pastor&#146;s Desk</b></p>
<p>June 14, 2009</p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>It&#146;s always good to have good news to share with you and today
I have some very good news. Our parishioner, Todd Strange, was
ordained to the priesthood here in the Cathedral yesterday.</p>
<p>Many of you know Todd. He came into the church back in 2001
through our RCIA program. After that he served as one of our
Eucharistic Ministers and quietly reached out in loving service to people
with special needs, including people in nursing homes and hospitals.</p>
<p>Todd is a gentle servant of the gospel and will be a wonderful priest.</p>
<p>Vocations to the priesthood are formed and fostered in many ways,
but I firmly believe that a parish community has a critically important
role to play in this regard. And Todd, I am sure, would be quick to
affirm that about our parish, about <i>you</i>. You have had a part in leading
him to the priesthood and his ordination is your celebration as well as
his.</p>
<p>Todd will preside at a Mass of Thanksgiving today at the noon Mass
here in the Cathedral. The Mass will be followed by a reception in the
Cathedral Hall to which you are all invited. I hope you will be able to
join Todd and his family as they and we give thanks to God for his
vocation to service and leadership in the Church.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b>
St. James is proud to welcome visitors from
near and far throughout the summer months.
Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will
be made from among all the visitor envelopes used.
Please write your address on the visitor envelope
provided in the pew and drop it with your offering into
the collection basket. Thank you for adding
to the power of our prayer by your presence in our
midst today. Last Sunday, we had
visitors from West Palm Beach, FL; Highland, NY, and
Mason, OH, to name a few. The winner of our drawing
was from Carmel, Indiana.</p>

<p><b>POSSIBLE PICKETERS</b>. It has come to our attention that
St. James Cathedral may be the site of some
demonstrations by outside groups following the
10:00am Mass this Sunday. There will likely be
picketers from a fringe evangelical group from Kansas
which espouses a message of hate toward gay and
lesbian people&#151;a message that is completely at odds
with Catholic teaching. The Church teaches clearly that
homosexual persons &#147;must be accepted with respect,
compassion and sensitivity.&#148; Rather than engage the
picketers in any kind of conversation, we urge you to
ignore them, to pray for them, and to focus your
attention on the Corpus Christi procession which is our
way of witnessing to the city our faith in Christ&#146;s
abiding presence in the sacrament of the Eucharist.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b> are in honor of the
graduating class of 2009 from Seattle University.
Flowers are also in thanksgiving for the newly ordained
priests, from the Archdiocese of Seattle.</p>
<p><b>COFFEE HOUR</b>. Please note that because of the Corpus
Christi Procession, there will be no coffee hour after the
10:00am Mass today. There will be coffee hour as usual
after the 8:00am Mass, and a special reception for Rev.
Todd Strange after the Noon Mass (all are welcome!).</p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. Stop by the bookstore
today for a great selection of Cathedral souvenirs…
postcards, note cards, books, mugs, magnets, and more!</p>
<p><b>SUMMER TOURS</b>. During the summer months, June,
July, and August, we offer a tour of the Cathedral every
Wednesday at 1:00pm. This is a great way to show out-of-town guests your Cathedral! No reservations
required.</p>
<p><b>TAIZÉ PRAYER AROUND THE CROSS</b>. Each Friday at
6:30 pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight, and
the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect way
to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>FEAST OF THE SACRED HEART OF JESUS</b>. This
coming Friday, June 19, the feast of the Sacred Heart of
Jesus, also marks the beginning of what Pope Benedict
XVI has called The Year of the Priest. We will have
Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament beginning
immediately after the 8:15am Mass, and continuing
until 1:00pm. Beginning at 12 Noon, we will have a
Holy Hour for Vocations, with rosary and readings
drawn from St. John Vianney, the patron saint of parish
priests, and concluding with Benediction of the Blessed
Sacrament. All are welcome.</p>
<p><b>SUMMER SHELTER TRAINING</b>. This July and August,
St. James will be partnering with Noel House and
Operation Nightwatch to provide overflow shelter on
Friday and Saturday nights to homeless women in our
community. We will be holding an orientation for all
interested volunteers on Tuesday, June 16 at 7pm in the
hall. Volunteers must be female and over the age of 18.

<p><b>CLOTHING DONATIONS NEEDED FOR YOUTH MIGRANT
PROJECT</b>. Next month, a group of teens from St. James

		<p>&$147;Annual Catholic Appeal&#148; season is drawing to a close.
But as you can see, we&#146;re not quite there yet. <b>We are
about $15,000 short of our goal!</b> Every dollar that comes
in now will be returned to the parish in the
form of a rebate to support our Cathedral
Kitchen and other outreach ministries. This
isn&#146;t just a &#147;bonus&#148;&#151;these are funds we
actually rely on to make these important
ministries happen. Your support at this

<p><b>WELCOME, PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN</b>. We
support all of our parishioners who are attending Mass
with young children and we welcome those children
into our midst. If you find that your child needs a quiet
place away from the stimulation of the Mass, please
feel free to step into the west vestibule or the cathedral
chapel, where we have provided a sound system so that
you can continue to participate in the Mass. We
appreciate your effort to be with us and to include your
child in our worship. <i>Please note that babysitting is
available in the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral
Outreach Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon

<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially
registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to register</i>.
Registered parishioners receive important mailings
from the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are
regular recipients of the Cathedral&#146;s highly acclaimed
journal <i>In Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate their
wedding at the Cathedral, and their children may attend
any of the five Catholic Rainbow Schools at
parishioner rates (and become eligible for Cathedral
scholarship money). In addition, if you are a registered
parishioner and use envelopes, or are on the direct
deposit program, we will mail you a quarterly report of
your contributions to the parish. Registration cards can
be found in the vestibule. Please drop the completed
card in the collection basket or put it in the mail.

<i>If you&#146;re not sure whether you&#146;re registered at St.

<p>We are the cathedral for the
Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle
and its Archbishop, The Most
Reverend Alexander J. Brunett.
We are also a parish church for a
vibrant faith community with a
long history that reaches back to
Seattle&#146;s early days.</p>
<p>We are an inner-city parish with an
outreach to many who live on the edge of
poverty and loneliness. We are a diverse
community that welcomes, accepts, and
celebrates the differences we all bring. We
exist in the heart of the city, yet sometimes
our parishioners come from considerable
distances to worship here.</p>
<p>St. James Cathedral is a crossroads where
ideas and challenges both old and new are
explored in the light of the Gospel of Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>Our cathedral is also the center for many
cultural and ecumenical events which both
reflect and help to shape the fabric of a vital
metropolitan community.</p>
<p>Above all, St. James Cathedral is a
community of prayer.</p>
