<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.
</i></p>
<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>
are a gift from Marcie
Madden and from the Pettigrew family.</p>
<p><b>GUEST CHOIR</b> Saturday 5:30. We welcome the United
States Naval Academy Men’s Glee Club, under the
direction of Dr. Aaron Smith.</p>
<p><b>SANDWICHES FOR ST. MARTIN DE PORRES</b> may be
dropped off at coffee hours this morning or at the parish
office tomorrow, Monday, November 9, until 3:00pm.</p>
<p><b>NEW IN THE BOOKSTORE</b>. We have a wide variety of
great Catholic books and Cathedral music on CD
(including the Solemn Mass of All Souls with Mozart’s
<i>Requiem</i>, recorded live in 2006). Also, just in are
Sunday Missals for 2010.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH?</b> You are invited to
participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the
Catholic community of faith. It is a process which
encompasses the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching,
and Christian values—the development and deepening
of a life of prayer and action—all with the support and
involvement of the parish community. A new inquiry
session began Wednesday, November 4 at 7:00
pm. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>MASS FOR DECEASED HOMELESS</b>. On Monday,
November 9, 2009, at 5:30pm, you are invited to a
special Mass in memory of the 81 men and women
who died on the streets of King County during the past
year. November 9 is the Feast of the Dedication of the
Lateran Basilica in Rome. As we recall the dedication
of a great house of God, we also remember that Christ
himself is still homeless, in his suffering brothers and
sisters throughout the world and on our streets. A
simple reception will follow the Mass. All are
welcome.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at 6:30
pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight, and
the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect way
to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>FOUNDATIONS IN FAITH—MORALITY</b>. Using the Bible,
<i>The Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>, and Church
documents, this adult enrichment program will explore
the Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes as the
framework of a moral life, identifying the call to
dignity for each human person and the common good
as two foundations of a moral life. Participants will
look at objective moral truth and the sources of moral
norms in the Church, and explore the Christian virtues
and how they are relevant to moral decision-making.
In addition, they will discuss what is meant by a
“well-formed conscience” and a process for Catholic
moral decision-making as well as the primacy of the
Church’s moral teaching in the life of the believer and
the inviolability of human conscience. Please bring
your Bible and copy of the Catechism to the class. The
class will take place on Sunday, November 22 at St.
Peter’s in Beacon Hill from 1:30-5:30pm. Cost: $5 per
class. (Cosponsored by St. James Cathedral with the
South Seattle Deanery) <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>YOUNG ADULTS (21 TO 30-SOMETHING), JOIN THE
CELEBRATION…</b> It has been a year since our first
“Thursday” Social – which has become a fun gathering
of regulars and new people alike. Because it has been
a popular location for previous Thursdays, we are
gathering again at the Capitol Club, 414 E. Pine St. for
fellowship and Mediterranean appetizers on Thursday,
November 12 at 7:00 pm. Join us in our Anniversary
celebration, and a hearty “thanks!” to all who have

<p><b>FUNERAL PLANNING</b>. Many people have questions
regarding funerals—questions ranging from the
Church’s position regarding cremation and burial to
how and when funerals are scheduled and celebrated in
the Cathedral. Since the time of the death of a loved
one is likely to be very emotionally draining, it is
clearly not the best time for dealing with such
questions. In an effort to help parishioners be prepared
ahead of time, the Cathedral offers a simple guide,
available at <a href="http://www.stjamescathedral.org/funerals/">our parish website</a>. The booklet may also be
obtained by calling the parish office.</p>
<p><b>FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS AT THE ALTAR</b>. Floral
offerings are a venerable custom in the Church, and a
wonderful way to remember a deceased loved one,
celebrate an anniversary, or give thanks for an
answered prayer. <i>Information</i>

<p><b>LET YOUR PRESENCE BE A PRESENT TO SOMEONE
IN NEED</b>. During times of personal crisis, in addition
to practical services, people often need the caring
presence of a compassionate person willing to
listen. The Solanus Casey Center, a program of St.
James Cathedral and Catholic Community Services,
seeks to provide that listening ear, as well as
referrals and limited assistance, to those in need in
our community. The Center is currently in need of a
few kind volunteers who can help one day a week
from 12:45pm-4:15pm. Training is
available. <i>Information</i>,

stay, the men receive toiletries they can use to freshen up before heading out 
for the day (many go to work). We are able to provide these toiletries thanks to 
generous donations of St. James parishioners. Please drop off any of the 
following unused items in the blue bin at coffee hour: disposable razors, cough 
drops, individually wrapped toothbrushes and travel-sized toothpaste. <i>Information</i>, Denise Carlascio, 425-687-7495.</p>
