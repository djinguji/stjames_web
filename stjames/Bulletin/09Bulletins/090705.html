<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b>
<i>St. James is proud to welcome visitors from near and far throughout the summer 
months. Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from among 
all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your address on the visitor 
envelope provided in the pew and drop it with your offering into the collection 
basket. Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your presence in our

place away from the stimulation of the Mass, please

chapel, where we have provided a sound system so that
you can continue to participate in the Mass. We
appreciate your effort to be with us and to include your
child in our worship. <i>Please note that babysitting is

<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially
registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to register</i>.
Registered parishioners receive important mailings from
the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are
regular recipients of the Cathedral’s quarterly journal <i>In
Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate their wedding at the
Cathedral, and their children may attend any of the five
Catholic Rainbow Schools at parishioner rates. If you
are a registered parishioner and use envelopes, or are on
the direct debit program, we will mail you a quarterly
report of your contributions to the parish. Registration
cards can be found in the vestibule. Please drop the
completed card in the collection basket or put it in the
mail. <i>If you’re not sure whether you’re registered at St.
James, call the parish office at 206-622-3559</i>.</p>
<p><b>SAVE THE DATE</b>. Our annual celebration of the Feast of
St. James the Greater and Parish Picnic will be on
Sunday, July 26. Many volunteers are needed to make
this great event happen. Details coming soon!</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>.
This week we remember in prayer the parishes of Saint
Benedict in Seattle, and St. Anne Mission in Blaine and
Tulalip.</p>
