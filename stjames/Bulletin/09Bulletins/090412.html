<p>There was no bulletin published for Easter Sunday. The following letter was 
published in the Order of Celebration.</p><hr>
<p><i>Easter Sunday, 2009</i></p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>It is a joy to be able to welcome you to St. James Cathedral on this Easter 
of 2009. I do so in the name of our Archbishop, Alexander J. Brunett, as well as 
in my own.</p>
<p>Of all the times we gather as Christian believers, none is more important 
than this one. Easter is the greatest of all of our feasts. It celebrates the 
Mystery that is the very foundation of our Christian faith, as St. Paul wrote, &quot;<i>If 
Christ has not risen, our faith is in vain</i>.&quot; (I Cor. 15:14)</p>
<p>But Christ <i>has</i> risen and your presence here in the Cathedral both 
affirms and celebrates that most startling and enduring of all realities. While 
we do not see him, we know he lives and that he is in our midst breathing life 
and hope into us, walking alongside us on our pilgrimage of faith, our journey 
toward the Kingdom.</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing what is in your heart as you come here on this 
Easter Sunday of 2009. For some, I am sure, there is joy and a keen sense of 
hope for the future as Spring with all its promise is bursting forth all around 
us; for others there may be the pain that comes from the death of a loved one. 
For all of us there is the stress and uncertainty brought about by the current 
economic meltdown out nation and our world are experiencing, and there is also 
the painful paradox of living in a world that, while incredibly beautiful, is 
also hopelessly violent. Death and life are never very far apart in our lives or 
in our world, are they? But death is not the whole story. Easter proclaims for 
all to hear the one thing that really matters, the one thing we need to know 
above all else: that death does not have the last word. Life does!</p>
<p>My prayer today is that you will be renewed in faith and hope as you join in 
worship here at St. James Cathedral.</p>
<p>If you are a visitor, please know that you are warmly welcomed here. I hope 
you will find something today that will touch your heart, awaken your spirit, 
and make you want to return to this holy place again and again. If you are part 
of the regular family of St. James, I take this opportunity to thank you for all 
the ways you make the Risen Lord Jesus present in this parish and in this city: 
through your prayer, your faith, and your love that overflows in such generous 
and unselfish service, especially to the poor.</p>
<p>May the blessings of the Risen Lord Jesus be your in abundance.</p>
<p><br>
Father Michael G. Ryan<br>
