      <li>Today&#146;s reading from St. Paul&#146;s letter to the Romans is one long sentence
        &#150; one long petition of praise to the Father. St. Paul praises God who has revealed
        &#147;the mystery kept secret for long ages&#148; in Jesus Christ. In some ways, the good
        news of Jesus still seems like a wellkept secret. How do you &#145;let the secret
        out&#146; in your daily life? </li>
      <li>At the beginning of this reading, St. Paul speaks of God as the one &#147;who can
