<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.
