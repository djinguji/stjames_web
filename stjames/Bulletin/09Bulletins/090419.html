<p><b>ESL ADVISORY BOARD MEMBERS</b>. If you care about
making a difference in the lives of refugees and
immigrants, and can commit to a few hours per month,
we want you! The ESL Advisory Board advocates for
immigration reform, helps plan, raises funds, evaluates
the program, and provides general program oversight.

<p><b>WOMEN HELPING WOMEN</b>. During the summer months
when satellite winter shelters are closed, many people
find themselves out on the streets with no place to
go. Homeless women are especially vulnerable during
this season. St. James is partnering with Operation Nightwatch to meet the housing needs of these women
by establishing a 3-month summer shelter for
women. We are looking for women volunteers (18+)
who are interested in serving as overnight hosts in
pairs. We are hoping to host the shelter here so we will
need a core of committed volunteers. Please consider
serving one or two nights a month. <i>Information</i>,

    the Cathedral and <a href="../../stpaul/stpaulhome.htm">online</a>.</i><p>“Let us celebrate the feast ... with the unleavened
bread of sincerity and truth.” This exhortation from
St. Paul, resounds even more powerfully in the
context of the Pauline Year. Let us accept the
Apostle’s invitation; let us open our spirit to Christ,
Who has died and is risen in order to renew us, in
order to remove from our hearts the poison of sin and
death, and to pour in the life-blood of the Holy Spirit:
divine and eternal life.” —<i>Pope Benedict XVI’s
