<p><b>From the Pastor&#146;s Desk</b></p>

<p>August 2, 2009</p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine how last weekend’s celebration of the feast of St.
James could have been any better. A few degrees drop in temperature might
have been nice but it doesn’t seem right for Seattleites to complain about
sunshine!</p>
<p>The picnic was fabulous and I want to thank the hard-working team who
made it happen. Special thanks go to Trent Mummery, Stephen Pace, and Larry
Brouse, along with a wonderful group of volunteers too numerous to mention
who did the set-ups, the cooking, the serving, the staffing, and the clean-up.
There were many highlights but for me but watching the faces of dozens of eager
and excited kids assaulting the pi&#328;ata scores high on my list. It was a great event
in every way. The best picnic ever!</p>
<p>We apologize for the fact that the Seattle policemen who normally do the
traffic control and directing outside the Cabrini Garage are not able to be with us
this weekend. The annual Seafair celebrations demand their presence elsewhere.
They will be back with us next weekend.</p>
<p>Summer is supposed to be a ‘down’ time but not around here. For us it’s a
good time to catch up on some major maintenance items. If you saw heavy
equipment in the Cathedral last week, it’s because we re-lamped every one of the
light fixtures in the Cathedral. As you might expect, this is an expensive item
(about $10,000!). Happily it only has to be done every-other-year. We are also
spending $20,000 for a new furnace in Cathedral Place and several thousand
dollars to replace many of the office and classroom windows in that building
with thermo-pane glass. In the long run, this work will involve considerable
cost-savings because of reduced energy consumption. Needless to say, I am more
than grateful for your generosity that makes it possible for us to maintain our
wonderful buildings.</p>
<p>I’m away in Spain this weekend for the wedding of a parishioner. Tough
duty, but someone has to do it!</p>
