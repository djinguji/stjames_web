<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b>
St. James is proud to welcome visitors from near and far throughout the summer 
months. Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from among 
all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your address on the visitor 
envelope provided in the pew and drop it with your offering into the collection 
basket. Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your presence in our 
midst today. Last Sunday, we had visitors from Venice, FL, San Juan Capistrano, CA,
and Yokohama, Japan, to name a few. The winner of
our drawing was from Boise, Idaho.</p>

disaster.</p>
<p><b>WALKING WITH OUR LADY</b>. The Health and Healing

Fair on May 5, you can bring your record sheet for June
to the Hall TODAY, Sunday, June 28, at coffee hour. If you’d like to join the 
fun and get healthier at the same time, stop by the table at coffee hour for a

<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH?</b> You are invited to
participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the
Catholic community of faith. It is a process which
encompasses the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching,
and Christian values—the development and deepening
of a life of prayer and action—all with the support and
involvement of the parish community. A new inquiry
session will begin Wednesday, July 8. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>WELCOME, PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN</b>. We
support all of our parishioners who are attending Mass
with young children and we welcome those children
into our midst. If you find that your child needs a quiet
place away from the stimulation of the Mass, please
feel free to step into the west vestibule or the cathedral
chapel, where we have provided a sound system so that
you can continue to participate in the Mass. We
appreciate your effort to be with us and to include your
child in our worship. <i>Please note that babysitting is
available in the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral
Outreach Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon
Masses</i>.</p>
<p><b>TOILETRIES DONATIONS NEEDED FOR WOMEN’S
SUMMER SHELTER</b>. St. James is starting a Summer
Shelter for women this July and August. As part of
their stay at our shelter, the women are given toiletries
to freshen up before they head out (many go to work in
the mornings). We are able to provide these toiletries
thanks to your generous donations. Please consider
dropping off any of the following <i>unused</i> items in the
blue bin at coffee hour: disposable razors, deodorant,

report of your contributions to the parish. Registration
cards can be found in the vestibule. Please drop the
completed card in the collection basket or put it in the
mail. <i>If you’re not sure whether you’re registered at St.
