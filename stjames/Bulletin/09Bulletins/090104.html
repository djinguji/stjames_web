<p align="left"><b>From the Desk of the Pastor</b></p>

<p align="left">Dear Friends,</p>

<p align="left">We will remember December of 2008! It was the Advent of the Deep Freeze,
the Christmas of the Great Snow. Never in my memory have we had weather so icy and cold
that we had a nearly empty Cathedral on the last two Sundays of Advent. Christmas was
better, but attendance was only about half of what it has been in past years. For those of
you who were unable to be here, I can well imagine how disappointed you were. Many of you,
I&#146;m sure, watched the Midnight Mass from St. James on television but that&#146;s a
poor substitute for being here in person. Another reminder of what an important part the
community plays in our life and worship&#133;.</p>

<p align="left">Any way you cut it, Seattle is a unique place. Only in Seattle would city
officials take to the airwaves to assure people that the major arterials would be kept
open for the benefit of those going to the football game on December 21 (making it clear
that that was the <i>only</i> reason people should consider going out!). Only in Seattle!
Despite that, a significant number of you did feel safe (and adventurous!) enough to make
the trek to the Cathedral on that Sunday from all over the region. You came from Capitol
Hill, Beacon Hill, and Rainier Valley; from Montlake and Mountlake Terrace, Magnolia and
Madison Park; from North Bend, Newcastle, Preston, Issaquah, Bellevue, Squak Mountain,
Federal Way, Shoreline, Sammamish, and Kenmore, and a whole lot of other places. I was
impressed!</p>

<p align="left">And I felt very badly for the hundreds and hundreds of you who
couldn&#146;t possibly get here. Some of you let us know through calls and e-mails how
much you missed being with the community during days when being together, and praying
together, and celebrating together in the Cathedral are the high point of your year.</p>

<p align="left">I would have to confess to you that, for me, those days were an important
learning time. If you know me at all, you know that I kind of like being on top of things
and that I expect things to go as planned! Well, God used those days to teach me a little
about my limits: about resignation, acceptance, and patience, gently reminding me that I
wasn&#146;t in charge (!) and that I ought, therefore, to relax a bit and let go. In a
wonderful way, God turned those days from being the winter of my discontent into the
winter of my discovery. It may not have been a lesson I was thrilled about getting, but I
have no doubt it was one I needed.</p>

<p align="left"><i>I know you won&#146;t take offense if I gently remind those of you who
were unable to be here on those Advent Sundays or on Christmas to send in your offering,
or put it in the collection basket next Sunday</i>. As you might expect, dramatically
reduced attendance resulted in drastically reduced collections. The actual shortfall for
those two Advent Sundays and Christmas (compared with last year) was $50,000! As you know,
we depend on every dollar to meet our payroll and program expenses, as well as to maintain
the Cathedral and other parish buildings.</p>

<p align="left">Here&#146;s a closing thought for those of you who weren&#146;t here for
Christmas. Go to our wonderful website and take a look at the beautiful albums of
photographs of the Christmas celebrations. Why, you can even read the Christmas homily if
you have the inclination. And the patience!</p>

<p align="left">Blessings for the New Year for you and your families.</p>
