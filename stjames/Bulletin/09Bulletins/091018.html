<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.

together for a greater respect for all life, from
conception to natural death?</p>

<p><b>SEATTLE HOUSING LEVY RENEWAL</b>. Proposition 1 on
November’s ballot will renew the Seattle Housing
Levy. You can see one success of the past levy across
9th Avenue from the Cathedral at Ozanam House. Our
Catholic faith teaches that a basic moral test of society
is how it treats the poor, and that every person made in
God’s image has a fundamental right to life and to
those things required for human decency, including
shelter. Please prayerfully reflect on these teachings of
our faith as you vote on the Housing Levy. More info at
