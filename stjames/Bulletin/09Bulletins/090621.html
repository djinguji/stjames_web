<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b>
St. James is proud to welcome visitors from near and far throughout the summer 
months. Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from among 
all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your address on the visitor 
envelope provided in the pew and drop it with your offering into the collection 
basket. Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your presence in our 
midst today. Last Sunday, we had
visitors from Boerne, TX, Winkelman, AZ, and Mt.
Pleasant, PA, to name a few. The winner of our

<p><b>10th ANNUAL SUMMER FILM FESTIVAL</b>. Join us
on Tuesday, July 14 at 7:00pm in Cathedral Place,
second floor, for the second film of the summer, <i>The
Secret Life of Bees</i>. Haunted by the death of her mother,
14 year-old Lily escapes the dreary life she lives on her
father&#146;s farm and heads to Tiburon, SC, with her friend
and caregiver Rosaleen, setting off on a life-changing
journey of self-discovery. Set amidst the hotbed of
racial tensions in the South in the 1960s, this dramatic
tale is based on the bestselling novel by Sue Monk
Kidd. Rated PG-13. Popcorn and lemonade will be
provided and you are welcome to bring your favorite
movie treats. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH?</b> You are invited to
participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the
Catholic community of faith. It is a process which
encompasses the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching,
and Christian values—the development and deepening
of a life of prayer and action—all with the support and
involvement of the parish community. A new inquiry
session will begin Wednesday, July 8. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>WELCOME, PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN</b>. We
support all of our parishioners who are attending Mass
with young children and we welcome those children
into our midst. If you find that your child needs a quiet
place away from the stimulation of the Mass, please
feel free to step into the west vestibule or the cathedral
chapel, where we have provided a sound system so that
you can continue to participate in the Mass. We
appreciate your effort to be with us and to include your
child in our worship. <i>Please note that babysitting is
available in the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral
Outreach Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon
Masses</i>.</p>
<p><b>REST IN PEACE</b>. Please pray for the repose of the soul of
Linda Condes.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b><font face="Verdana">:</font> <i>Throughout the year because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>.

Immaculate Heart of Mary in Sedro Woolley; Sacred Heart
