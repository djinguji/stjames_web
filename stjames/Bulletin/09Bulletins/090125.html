<p><strong>FROM THE DESK OF THE PASTOR</strong> </p>

<p><i>January 25, 2009 </i></p>

<p>Dear Friends, </p>

<p>On this Feast of the Conversion of St. Paul, we are fortunate to have as our guest
homilist Father John Endres, S.J. Father Endres is an Oregon Province Jesuit and a native
of Tacoma. I&#146;ve had the privilege of knowing him and his family since I was a very
young priest at St. Patrick&#146;s parish in Tacoma where they were parishioners. John is
currently a professor of Sacred Scripture at the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley. He
has the added distinction of having been ordained to the priesthood here in St. James
Cathedral by Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen. It is a joy to be able to welcome John to the
pulpit of St. James! </p>

<p>Some more good news. As of this writing, 313 &#147;snow angels&#148; have helped rescue
the Cathedral from the December snowfall/shortfall. This is pretty remarkable. No, let me
rephrase that: you are pretty remarkable! </p>

<p>I&#146;m told that there are people who don&#146;t believe in angels. I don&#146;t have
to believe in them. I&#146;ve <i>met</i> them! </p>

<p>You may recall that our shortfall for those two Advent Sundays and Christmas was
$50,000. Thanks to so many of you who sent your envelopes in later, and thanks to each one
of you who signed on as a snow angel, we are quite close to making up all our losses. </p>

<p>What incredible people you are! I am grateful beyond words. </p>

<p><b>Father Michael G. Ryan</b><br>
<em>Cathedral Pastor</em></p>

<p>P.S. There&#146;s still time to become a &#147;snow angel.&#148; Just write <i>snow
angel</i> on the memo line of your check (or on the visitor envelope) and drop it in the
basket along with your regular offering. Thank you! </p>

<p><b>WELCOME:</b> If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know how welcome
you are &#150; whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city. </p>

<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b> are from Frank and Carol Robl, in memory of Marie Grady

St. Paul, the patron saint of journalists, reporters, and newspaper staff? </p>

<p><b>HELP A SENIOR IN NEED</b>. Many people in our St. James community and beyond are in
need of help with transportation, shopping, laundry, housework, and more. Age, illness,
economics, and disabilities can all be barriers to accomplishing these routine daily
tasks. By volunteering just a few hours a month, you can make a huge difference in
someone&#146;s life by providing them peace of mind and the option to stay in their own
home rather than going to an institutionalized setting. If you are interested in joining
this rewarding ministry, please come to the Orientation to be held in the Pastoral
Outreach Center on Tuesday, January 27 at 6:30 pm. <i>Information</i> <a
