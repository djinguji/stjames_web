<p><b>WOMEN HELPING WOMEN</b>. During the summer
months when satellite winter shelters are closed,
many people find themselves out on the streets
with no place to go. Homeless women are
especially vulnerable during this season. St. James
is partnering with Operation Nightwatch to meet
the housing needs of these women by establishing
a 3-month summer shelter for women. We are
looking for women volunteers (18+) who are
interested in serving as overnight hosts in
pairs. We are hoping to provide as many nights as
possible so we will need a core of committed
volunteers. Please consider serving one or two
nights a month. <i>Information</i>,

meals and St. James is responding by adding a
second night of service to our current Sandwich
Ministry. We need a whole new crew of
volunteers who can help us make 300+ sandwiches
for the 4th Monday of each month. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never
officially registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to
register</i>. Registered parishioners receive important
mailings from the Cathedral (including offering
envelopes!), are regular recipients of the Cathedral’s
highly acclaimed journal <i>In Your Midst</i>, are able to
celebrate their wedding at the Cathedral, and their
children may attend any of the five Catholic Rainbow
Schools at parishioner rates (and become eligible for
Cathedral scholarship money). In addition, if you are a
registered parishioner and use envelopes, or are on the
direct deposit program, we will mail you a quarterly
report of your contributions to the parish. Registration
cards can be found in the vestibule. Please drop the
completed card in the collection basket or put it in the
mail.</p>

safe place, in the company of others who are also
examining their faith, to ask questions about returning to

July 13 in Cathedral Place, 2nd floor. Classes are
offered without any obligation. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>FOUNDATIONS IN OUR CATHOLIC FAITH: THE
FOUNDING OF THE CHURCH</b>. TODAY, Sunday, April
26, 1:30–5:30 pm at St. Peter’s Parish Hall. In this
course, participants will focus on the importance of
Apostolic Succession and the roles of the Hierarchy as
the Church moved through the centuries, formulating a
Creed, defining the Canon of Scripture, and developing
the Sacraments. They will explore how the Sacraments
foster holiness, community, and continuity with the
Apostolic Church. Please bring your Bible and copy of
the Catechism to the class. This program is a wonderful
opportunity to continue to grow as mature and well-informed
Catholics. (Co-sponsored by St. James
Cathedral with the South Seattle Deanery) <i>Information</i>,

    <p><i>Be sure to visit the place of prayer for the year of St. Paul in the south aisle of
    the Cathedral and <a href="../../stpaul/stpaulhome.htm">online</a>.</i><p>In the Letter to the Galatians, St Paul gives a very
personal profession of faith in which he opens his
heart to readers of all times and reveals what was the
most intimate drive of his life. “I live by faith in the
Son of God who loved me and gave himself for
me” (Gal 2: 20). All Paul’s actions begin from this
centre. His faith is the experience of being loved by
Jesus Christ in a very personal way. It is awareness of
the fact that Christ did not face death for something
anonymous but rather for love of him—of Paul—and
that, as the Risen One, he still loves him; in other
words, Christ gave himself for him. Paul's faith is
being struck by the love of Jesus Christ, a love that
overwhelms him to his depths and transforms him.
His faith is not a theory, an opinion about God and the
world. His faith is the impact of God’s love in his
heart.—<i>Pope Benedict XVI, Homily for the Opening
of the Pauline Year, June 28, 2008</i></p>
