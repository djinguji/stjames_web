<p><b>From the Pastor&#146;s Desk</b></p>
<p>October 4, 2009</p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>With October comes Respect Life month. So precious is the gift of human life that
once a year our bishops set aside a full month for us to reflect on it and to pray about it.
In last Sunday’s bulletin (it’s also <a href="../../respectlife/lifemain.htm">online</a> at our website) you saw an insert that set the
stage for this annual observance. It set forth very clearly and strongly what is commonly
called the Church’s “consistent ethic of life,” or to use the phrase often used by the late
Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, the “seamless garment” that is human life. Included in this
seamless garment are issues such as abortion, stem cell research, euthanasia and assisted
suicide, capital punishment, torture, war and terrorism, health care, homelessness, and a
whole range of poverty issues—in a word, every issue that in any way impacts or
adversely affects the precious gift of human life. The Church may not assign equal
importance to each issue but its teaching about life makes sense, not when we pick and
choose among them, but only when every one of them is taken into account and taken
seriously. It is one of the glories of the Catholic Church that we are identified as being
outspoken advocates for human life—all of human life.</p>
<p>On each of these October Sundays a different bulletin insert will offer some
reflections and talking points on several of the great human life issues. I hope you will
take time to read them and ponder them. I also hope you will make these issues a part of
your personal prayer and your family prayer during these days.</p>
<p>On another note, I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your
wonderfully generous response to the Build Hope collection this year. It is always very
moving to me—and very humbling—to witness your generosity in response to an
appeal. Thanks to you, we will be able to meet the goal set for us by the Archdiocese to
support the Catholics Come Home media project that will take place during Lent of the
coming year. Again, my heartfelt thanks.</p>
<p>The Archbishop Hunthausen Charity Golf Tournament last Monday was a great
success and that was no easy achievement during down economic times. Thanks to a
whole lot of good people, we raised significant funds that will be used to support our
many Cathedral social outreach programs. Archbishop Hunthausen was unable to be
with us this year but we felt his spirit there as we raised money for causes dear to his
heart.</p>
<p>Fall is definitely upon us. For me, that means a welcome hiatus in the weekend
wedding schedule and an opportunity to get away for some vacation. I’m ready. I’ll
miss you, but something tells me I’ll get over it…! See you in a couple of weeks!</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.

rosary will be prayed in the Cathedral at 6:00pm (shortly
following the 5:30pm Mass). What better way to
observe Respect Life Month, than by praying the rosary
together for a greater respect for all life, from
conception to natural death?</p>

may be dropped off in Catheral Hall during the Sunday
morning coffee hours next Sunday, October 11. You

<p><b>ADVOCACY TRAINING</b>. During the year over 24,000
people experience homelessness in King County, many
of whom are families with children. On Saturday,
October 10 from 10:00am-Noon in Cathedral Hall, the
St. James Housing Advocacy Committee will co-host a
training program to make advocacy for the homeless
politically effective, simple, and yes, even fun! This
free program will be conducted by Nancy Amidei, a
national expert in advocacy training who is renowned
for her knowledge and the joy she brings to this
important learning event. <i>Information</i>,
