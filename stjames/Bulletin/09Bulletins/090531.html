		<p>Thank you to all who have turned in or mailed in your
pledge. The response has been truly remarkable. <b>But as
you can see, we aren’t there yet!</b> Every dollar that comes
in now will be returned to the parish in the form of a
rebate to support our Cathedral Kitchen and other
outreach ministries. This isn’t just a “bonus”—these are
funds we actually rely on to make these important
ministries happen. Your support is <i>crucial</i>!</p>
<p><b>If you’re not sure what to give, would you
consider a gift of $365 (that’s just $1 per
day)?</b> You may make a one-time gift or
spread your gift out over as many as ten
months. There are many options to make it
easy and convenient to give. Thank you for
your generous response!</p>

chapel, where we have provided a sound system so that
you can continue to participate in the Mass. We
appreciate your effort to be with us and to include your
child in our worship. <i>Please note that babysitting is

make a huge difference in someone’s life, provide
them peace of mind, and help them to stay in their

<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially
registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to register</i>.
Registered parishioners receive important mailings
from the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are
regular recipients of the Cathedral’s highly acclaimed
journal <i>In Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate their
wedding at the Cathedral, and their children may attend
any of the five Catholic Rainbow Schools at
parishioner rates (and become eligible for Cathedral
scholarship money). In addition, if you are a registered
parishioner and use envelopes, or are on the direct
deposit program, we will mail you a quarterly report of
your contributions to the parish. Registration cards can
be found in the vestibule. Please drop the completed
card in the collection basket or put it in the mail.
