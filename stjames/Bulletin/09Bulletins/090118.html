    <p><b>HELP A SENIOR IN NEED</b>. Many people in our St. James community and beyond are in
    need of help with transportation, shopping, laundry, housework, and more. Age, illness,
    economics, and disabilities can all be barriers to accomplishing these routine daily
    tasks. By volunteering just a few hours a month, you can make a huge difference in
    someone&#146;s life by providing them peace of mind and the option to stay in their own
    home rather than going to an institutionalized setting. If you are interested in joining
    this rewarding ministry, please come to the Orientation to be held in the Pastoral
    Outreach Center on Tuesday, January 27 at 6:30 pm. <i>Information</i> <a

      <li>Today we begin a sequence of readings from <i>First Corinthians</i>. In some of his
        letters, Paul emphasizes the tension between soul and body; but here, he reminds the
        Corinthians of the integrity of the whole human person. &quot;Your bodies are members of
        Christ,&quot; he says. What are the implications of this statement for our Christian
        theology of the body? </li>
      <li>Paul urges the Corinthians to &quot;glorify God in your body.&quot; The great runner
        Eric Liddell, whose story is told in the film &quot;Chariots of Fire,&quot; echoes these
        words of St. Paul when he says &quot;God made me fast, and when I run, I feel His pleasure
        in my speed.&quot; How do you &quot;glorify God in your body&quot;? </li>
