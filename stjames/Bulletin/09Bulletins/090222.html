<p><strong>FROM THE DESK OF THE PASTOR</strong> </p>

<p>February 22, 2009</p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>The Cathedral choirs are getting a break today. I think you&#8217;ll agree
that they&#8217;ve more than earned one after doing <i>Great Music for Great
Cathedrals</i> three nights in a row&#8212;not to mention all the rehearsal time
beforehand. So the pressure is on <i>us</i> this weekend. We get to be the
choir. I have no doubt that we will more than measure up.</p>
<p>Speaking of measuring up: you have done that and more in the
recent &#8220;Snow Angel&#8221; campaign to make up for the shortfall we
experienced during the &#8220;Winter of Our Discontent.&#8221; You may
remember that the collection shortfall from the Advent and Christmas
snow and ice storms was $25,000. We have more than made up for that,
thanks to your incredible response to my invitation to become &#8220;snow
angels.&#8221; <b>As of this writing, 489 of you have sprouted angel wings,
contributing $41,018!</b> That&#8217;s nothing short of remarkable. The funds
donated over and above the goal will be used to support the Cathedral
Kitchen.</p>
<p>Even though I would like to have thanked each of you individually
for your gift, I&#8217;m trusting you will agree with me that saving postage
was even a higher value. Please know, however, how deeply grateful I
am. Your generosity never ceases to amaze and inspire me.</p>
<p><b>Father Michael G. Ryan</b><br>
<em>Cathedral Pastor</em></p>

<p><b>WELCOME:</b> If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know how welcome

world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city. </p>

      <li>St. Paul often uses unexpected comparisons to help
us understand the mystery of Jesus Christ.
Today&#8217;s reading is a case in point. Jesus, he says,
is God&#8217;s &#8220;yes.&#8221; What does this simple word &#8220;yes&#8221;
say to you today?
		</li>
		<li>St. Paul also uses an unusual comparison drawn
from the language of finance. God will be faithful
to his promise to bring us to eternal life. How do
we know? Because he has &#8220;put his seal on us&#8221; and
given us the Holy Spirit &#8220;as a first installment&#8221;!
What do you imagine the &#8220;second installment&#8221; will
be?
