<p><i>Because of the importance of this year’s Build Hope Campaign, Father Ryan’s letter of
last Sunday is being reprinted for the sake of those who may not have been able to be here.</i></p>
<hr>
<p><b>From the Pastor&#146;s Desk</b></p>
<p>September 13, 2009</p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>This is “Back to School” time for many of our children. It may also be
“Back to the Cathedral” time for families that have been traveling this summer or
perhaps attending church closer to home. In any case, it’s wonderful to be
together again! While summer brought us the largest number of visitors in my
memory, no visitor could ever take your place!</p>
<p>It’s good, too, to have the Cathedral Choir back with us at the 10:00 Mass.
Next week, we will welcome back the Women’s Schola to the Sunday evening
Mass.</p>
<p>The special “Build Hope” collection today has an importance beyond what
it has had in past years. A major purpose of this collection has long been to fund,
at the national level, the use of the media for preaching the gospel message. <i>This
year, however, the emphasis will be on buying time on <b>local media</b> (especially
television)</i>. During Lent 2010, the Archdiocese will be undertaking a massive local
media campaign called “Catholics Come Home.” It will involve a series of very
thought-provoking television spots addressed to Catholics who no longer
practice their faith as well as others who might be interested in exploring the
Catholic faith. Needless to say, the television time is extremely expensive but I
think you will agree that the cause is more than worthwhile.</p>
<p><b>Our parish has been asked to contribute $12,000 to the “Catholics Come
Home” media campaign. In order to meet this, I need to ask that you consider
giving a larger gift to the Build Hope collection than you may have done in the
past. I know each of you will do what you can because you always do.</b>
<b><i>A suggestion: a gift of $35 from each of our regular contributors would 
allow us to meet our goal</i></b>.</p>
<p>Let me thank you in advance. As always, I am deeply grateful for your
generosity.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.
</i></p>
<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>
are in memory of David
Pettigrew, from his family. 
Floral offerings are a
venerable custom in the Church, and a wonderful way to
remember a deceased loved one, celebrate an
anniversary, or give thanks for an answered prayer.

THE CHURCH?</b> It is not too late to join our Welcome Back program—a safe place, in the company of others who are also
examining their faith, to ask questions about returning
to regular church attendance, returning to the
sacraments, and to learn about changes in the
church. The 1st session was last Monday, but you can still join us Monday, 
September 21 from 7:00-9:00pm and then each Monday through December 7 in 
Cathedral Place, 2nd floor. Classes are offered without

<p><b>HELP A SENIOR IN NEED</b>. Many in our community are
in need of help with transportation, shopping, laundry,
housework, and more. Age, illness, economics, and
disabilities can all be barriers to accomplishing these
routine, daily tasks. By volunteering just a few hours a
month, you can make a huge difference in someone’s
life, provide them peace of mind, and help them stay in
their own home rather than going to an institutionalized
setting. If you are interested in joining this rewarding
ministry, please come to the orientation on the 1st floor
of the Pastoral Outreach Center on Tuesday, September
22 at 6:30pm. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ADVOCACY TRAINING</b>. During the year over 24,000

St. James Housing Advocacy Committee will co-host a
training program for making advocacy for the
homeless politically effective, simple, and yes, even
fun! This free program will be conducted by Nancy Amidei, a national expert in advocacy training who is
renowned for her knowledge and the joy she brings to
this important learning event. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>PARISH CENSUS</b>. For the first time in many years, we
are conducting a census of our parish families, inviting
each registered household to update phone and e-mail
information. A huge thank you to the more than 500
families who completed the census via e-mail this past
week. If you are registered at St. James Cathedral,
look for a letter in the mail this coming week. It will
only take a moment or two to review the information
and return it to the parish office. You may also bring it
with you to Mass and drop it in the offering basket
(this will save on postage!). Thank you!</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>.
This week we remember in prayer the parishes of St.
Matthew in Seattle, St. Gabriel in Port Orchard, St. Jerome
in Ocean Shores, St. Therese in Seattle, and St. Theresa in
Federal Way.</p>
