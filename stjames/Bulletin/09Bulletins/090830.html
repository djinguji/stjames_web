<p><b>ENGAGING SPIRITUALITY</b> focuses on the link between
spirituality and engaged compassion by emphasizing
personal and collective prayer, reflection on the
writings of spiritual masters, personal experiences with
the poor, and contemplative dialogue in a small faith
community. This 21-week program taps into ancient
and contemporary wisdom and inspires participants to
develop spiritual practices that keep them rooted in
Gospel justice and grounded in love. Engaging
Spirituality is a program of JustFaith Ministries, and is
being offered for the second year here at St. James
Cathedral. Sessions will be held on Thursday
evenings beginning in October. Learn more about the
program at an Information Night Monday, September

<p><b>FUNERAL PLANNING</b>. Many people have questions
regarding funerals—questions ranging from the
Church’s position regarding cremation and burial to
how and when funerals are scheduled and celebrated in
the Cathedral. Since the time of the death of a loved
one is likely to be very emotionally draining, it is
clearly not the best time for dealing with such
questions. In an effort to help parishioners be prepared
ahead of time, the Cathedral offers a simple guide, available at our 
<a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/funerals">parish website</a>. The booklet may also obtained
by calling the parish office.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>.
This week we remember in prayer the parishes of Blessed
Teresa of Calcutta in Woodinville, St. Rose of Viterbo in
Longview, and St. John Chrysostom (Byzantine) in Seattle. </p>
