you are &#150; whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city. </p>

    <p><i>Each week during the coming Year of St. Paul, watch this space in the bulletin for
    reflection questions that will lead us deeper into the writings and example of St. Paul.
    You are also invited to visit the Place of Prayer in the west aisle and on the <a

      <li>&#147;Woe to me if I do not preach [the gospel],&#148; writes St. Paul in today&#146;s
        reading from First Corinthians &#150; or, as another translation has it, &#147;I&#146;m in
        pain if I don&#146;t preach the gospel.&#148; Paul&#146;s preaching is urgent, even
        breathless. What is it that drives Paul? What drives you? </li>
      <li>&#147;I have become all things to all,&#148; St. Paul writes. Our third bishop, Bishop
        Edward J. O&#146;Dea, chose these words for his episcopal motto. What do you think Paul
        means by this? Do you see this approach to the Gospel reflected in Paul&#146;s letters? </li>
