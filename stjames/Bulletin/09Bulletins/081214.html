<p><b>THANK YOU FOR SUPPORT OF ST. MARTIN&#146;S</b>. Thank you to all who wrote letters
and emails to keep St. Martin de Porres Shelter and the Lazarus Day Center open 7 days a
week. The City Council approved an increase of $100,000 that will be divided evenly
between day center(s) and a shelter for men over 55. While the two Archdiocesan Housing
Authority programs were not specified, the City Council has indicated that these programs
are the most likely candidates for these funds and AHA is celebrating it as a victory!
Your support helped to make this possible in very difficult economic times. <i>Information</i>,
