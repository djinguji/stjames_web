<p><b>WELCOME</b>: If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know how welcome
you are &#151; whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city.</p>

<p><b>REST IN PEACE</b>. Please pray for the repose of the souls of Gordon Pugel,
Katharine Frasher, and Jean Thorpe.</p>

<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. Stop by the Cathedral Bookstore today for a terrific
selection of books, including <i>In Due Season</i>, a brand-new memoir by Paul Wilkes, who
spoke at the Cathedral last summer. &#147;<i>In Due Season</i> ranks alongside
Merton&#146;s best because Wilkes absorbed Merton, then moved forward with him, and
ultimately beyond him&#148; (NCR).</p>

<p><b>EASTER FLOWERS</b>. Your generous offerings will help to beautify the Cathedral for
the coming great feast of Easter. Envelopes are available in the pews. Thank you for your
generosity.</p>

<p><b>EASTER SUNDAY</b>. Please note that there will be no coffee hour offered on Easter
Sunday morning, and the Cathedral Bookstore will be closed.</p>

<p><b>NEW ON THE WEBSITE</b>. Download the complete schedule of Holy Week liturgies, and
visit our special Holy Week feature to learn more about the history of the great liturgies
ahead. </p>

<p><b>TAIZÉ PRAYER AROUND THE CROSS</b>. Please note that there will be no Ecumenical
Prayer with Music from Taizé this Friday, Good Friday. We will resume our weekly Taizé
Prayer with Festival of Lights on Friday, April 17.</p>

<p><b>THE FIRST SENIOR TRIP</b> for the 2009 season will be April 15 &#151; weather and
bloom permitting! The journey will include lunch at a Mount Vernon buffet, a tour of two
tulip fields, and time to enjoy God&#146;s creation as well as his people. <i>Information,

to registered parishioners!</p>

<p><b>ARE YOU A CATHOLIC WHO HAS BEEN AWAY FROM THE CHURCH?</b> Our Welcome Back program
provides a safe place, in the company of others who are also examining their faith, to ask
questions about returning to regular church attendance, returning to the sacraments, and
to learn about changes in the church. The sessions are offered on Mondays from
7:00-9:00pm, April 20 through July13 in Cathedral Place, 2nd floor. Classes are offered
without any obligation. <i>Information</i>, <a

    making a difference in the lives of refugees and immigrants, and can commit to a few hours
    per month, we want you! The ESL Advisory Board advocates for immigration reform, helps
    plan, raises funds, evaluates the program, and provides general program oversight. We meet
    on the third Tuesday of each month from 6:00 to 7:30pm. We ask for a commitment of two

    <p><b>WOMEN HELPING WOMEN</b>. During the summer months when satellite winter shelters are
    closed, many people find themselves out on the streets with no place to go. Homeless women
    are especially vulnerable during this season. St. James is partnering with Operation
    Nightwatch to meet the housing needs of these women by establishing a 3-month summer
    shelter for women. We are looking for women volunteers (18+) who are interested in serving
    as overnight hosts in pairs. We are hoping to host the shelter here so we will need a core
    of committed volunteers. Please consider serving one or two nights a month. <i>Information</i>,

to participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the Catholic community of faith.
It is a process which encompasses the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching, and Christian

the support and involvement of the parish community. A new inquiry session will begin

      <li>Christ takes on &#147;the form of a slave&#148; for our salvation. The saints have
        followed Christ&#146;s example, becoming the servants of all (think of Mother Teresa, or
        of St. Martin de Porres). Are there people in your life who follow Christ&#146;s example
        of service?</li>
      <li>&#147;Christ humbled himself, becoming obedient.&#148; What does it mean to be humble?
