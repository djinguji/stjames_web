<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b>
<i>St. James is proud to welcome visitors from near and far throughout the summer 
months. Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from among 
all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your address on the visitor 
envelope provided in the pew and drop it with your offering into the collection 
basket. Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your presence in our 
midst today. 
Last weekend, we
had visitors from San Anselmo, CA; King George, VA;
and Seoul, Korea, to name a few. The winner of our
drawing was from Florissant, MO.</i></p>

Robinson-Leon from the Quintana-Leon family.

pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight, and
the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect way

<p><b>10TH ANNUAL SUMMER FILM FESTIVAL</b>. Join
us Tuesday, August 18 (<i>note date change!</i>) at 7:00pm in
Cathedral Place, second floor for the last film of the
summer: <i>Gran Torino</i>. A crusty, inflexible Korean
War veteran must confront his Hmong immigrant
neighbors—and his prejudices—when the family’s teen
son tries to steal his beloved Gran Torino. Walt soon
assumes the unlikely role of guardian angel to him and
his family bringing about reconciliation and his own
redemption. Rated R. Popcorn and lemonade will be
provided and you are welcome to bring your favorite
movie treats. <i>Information</i>,

involvement of the parish community. A new inquiry
session will begin on Wednesday, September 9.

<p><b>FOUNDATIONS IN FAITH—WHAT DOES THE
CATHOLIC CHURCH BELIEVE AND WHAT
DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IT MY LIFE?</b> What does
the Catholic Church believe and what difference does
it make it my life? Using the Bible, <i>The Catechism of
the Catholic Church</i>, and Church documents, this adult
enrichment program will explore the Catholic
interpretation of scripture, key theological concepts,
and the history of the Church. This is a wonderful
opportunity for an in-depth look at Catholic teaching
and its implications for our everyday lives. Classes
this year include Israel’s Sacred History, Morality,
Christology and Church, Sacraments and Liturgy,
Gospel of John, and Council of Trent/Vatican II. You
can come to one or all classes. Classes take place on
9/20, 10/18, 11/22, 2/21, 3/7, 3/21 and 4/18 at St.
Peter’s in Beacon Hill from 1:30-5:30 PM. Cost: $5
per class. (Cosponsored by St. James Cathedral with
the South Seattle Deanery) <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>FUNERAL PLANNING</b>. Many people have questions
regarding funerals—questions ranging from the
Church’s position regarding cremation and burial to
how and when funerals are scheduled and celebrated in
the Cathedral. Since the time of the death of a loved
one is likely to be very emotionally draining, it is
clearly not the best time for dealing with such
questions. In an effort to help parishioners be prepared
ahead of time, the Cathedral offers a simple little
booklet that can be obtained by calling the parish
office. It is also available at our 
<a href="http://www.stjamescathedral.org/funerals">parish website</a>.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>.
This week we remember in prayer the parishes of
Queen of Heaven in Tacoma; Queen of Angels in Port
Angeles, and Mary, Queen of Peace in Sammamish.</p>
