know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.

<p><b>WINTER SHELTER TOILETRIES DONATIONS NEEDED</b>.
St. James starts its 18th year of Winter Shelter this
weekend. An important piece of the ministry is
toiletries distribution. As part of their overnight stay,
the men receive toiletries they can use to freshen up
before heading out for the day (many go to work). We
are able to provide these toiletries thanks to generous
donations given by St. James parishioners. Please
drop off any of the following unused items in the blue
bin at coffee hour: disposable razors, cough drops,
individually wrapped toothbrushes and travel-sized
toothpaste. <i>Information</i>, Denise Carlascio, 425-687-7495.</p>
