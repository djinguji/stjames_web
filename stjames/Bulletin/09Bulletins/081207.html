    <p>Next month, we have two unique ways to celebrate the Year of St. Paul. On Wednesday, <b>January
    21, 2009 at 7:00 pm</b>, St. James will host a countywide prayer for Christian Unity. What
    better way to celebrate the Year of St. Paul than by praying for the unity of Christians?
    Our guest preacher will be Dr. Michael Kinnamon, President of the National Council of
    Churches of Christ in the USA and a widely-respected leader in the ecumenical movement.
    Bring a friend from another Christian denomination, and bring Paul&#146;s vision of the
    Church to life! The service is cosponsored by the Church Council of Greater Seattle, the
    School of Theology and Ministry of Seattle University, and St. James Cathedral. Please
    visit <a class="navy" href="http://www.thechurchcouncil.org">www.thechurchcouncil.org</a>,
    or <a href="../../Events/2009/unity09.htm">our parish website</a> for more information. The
    following Sunday, <b>January 25</b>, we have the rare opportunity to celebrate the Feast
    of the Conversion of St. Paul on a Sunday. Noted scripture scholar Father John Endres, SJ,
    will be guest homilist at all Masses for the feast. </td>
