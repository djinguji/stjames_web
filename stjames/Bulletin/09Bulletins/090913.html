<p><b>From the Pastor&#146;s Desk</b></p>
<p>September 13, 2009</p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>This is “Back to School” time for many of our children. It may also be
“Back to the Cathedral” time for families that have been traveling this summer or
perhaps attending church closer to home. In any case, it’s wonderful to be
together again! While summer brought us the largest number of visitors in my
memory, no visitor could ever take your place!</p>
<p>It’s good, too, to have the Cathedral Choir back with us at the 10:00 Mass.
Next week, we will welcome back the Women’s Schola to the Sunday evening
Mass.</p>
<p>The special “Build Hope” collection today has an importance beyond what
it has had in past years. A major purpose of this collection has long been to fund,
at the national level, the use of the media for preaching the gospel message. <i>This
year, however, the emphasis will be on buying time on <b>local media</b> (especially
television)</i>. During Lent 2010, the Archdiocese will be undertaking a massive local
media campaign called “Catholics Come Home.” It will involve a series of very
thought-provoking television spots addressed to Catholics who no longer
practice their faith as well as others who might be interested in exploring the
Catholic faith. Needless to say, the television time is extremely expensive but I
think you will agree that the cause is more than worthwhile.</p>
<p>Our parish has been asked to contribute $12,000 to the “Catholics Come
Home” media campaign. In order to meet this, I need to ask that you consider
giving a larger gift to the Build Hope collection than you may have done in the
past. I know each of you will do what you can because you always do.
<b><i>A suggestion: a gift of $35 from each of our regular contributors would 
allow us to meet our goal</i></b>.</p>
<p>Let me thank you in advance. As always, I am deeply grateful for your
generosity.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to 
know how welcome you 
are — whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the 
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, 
to the generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church's 
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide 
range of services to needy people living in the central district of our city.
