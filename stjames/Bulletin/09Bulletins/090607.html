<p><b>From the Pastor's Desk</b></p>
<p>June 7, 2009</p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>
It’s always good to have good news to share with you and today
I have some very good news. Our parishioner, Todd Strange, will be
ordained to the priesthood here in the Cathedral next Saturday, June 13.</p>
<p>Many of you know Todd. He came into the church back in 2001
through our RCIA program. After that he served as one of our
Eucharistic Ministers and quietly reached out in loving service to people
with special needs, including people in nursing homes and hospitals.</p>
<p>Todd is a gentle servant of the gospel and will be a wonderful priest.</p>
<p>Vocations to the priesthood are formed and fostered in many ways,
but I firmly believe that a parish community has a critically important
role to play in this regard. And Todd, I am sure, would be quick to
affirm that about our parish, about <i>you</i>. You have had a part in leading
him to the priesthood and his ordination is your celebration as well as
his.</p>
<p>The ordination will take place in next Saturday at 10:00 in the
morning. Seating will be limited because there are several men being
ordained, but the next day, the feast of Corpus Christi, Todd will preside
at a Mass of Thanksgiving at the noon Mass here in the Cathedral, and
there will be plenty of seats for that! The Mass will be followed by a
reception in the Cathedral Hall to which you are all invited. I hope you
will be able to join Todd and his family next weekend as they and we
give thanks to God for his vocation to service and leadership in the
Church.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b>
St. James is proud to welcome visitors from
near and far throughout the summer months.
Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will
be made from among all the visitor envelopes used.
Please write your address on the visitor envelope

the collection basket. Thank you for adding
to the power of our prayer by your presence in our
midst today.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b> are in memory of
Thomas Comer from his wife Anne, on the 10th
anniversary of his death.</p>
<p><b>MUSIC AT 10:00AM SUNDAY</b>. The Cathedral Chamber
Orchestra is made possible through a donation in
appreciation for all the musicians of St. James.</p>
<p><b>CHILDREN’S FAITH FORMATION</b>. The gift bearers at
noon Mass today are our wonderful Children’s Faith
Formation volunteers who faithfully prepare lessons
and teach the ways of faith to the children of our parish
every Sunday throughout the year. Others watch the
door and help keep our children safe. We honor thank
them for helping these children to grow in their faith
and their loving relationship with Jesus.</p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. Stop by the bookstore
today for a great selection of Cathedral souvenirs…
postcards, notecards, books, mugs, magnets, and more!</p>
<p><b>THE GLOBAL WATER CRISIS: A CHRISTIAN RESPONSE</b>. Seattle University 
Professor of Christian Ethics Gary Chamberlain, author of <i>Troubled Waters: 
Religion, Ethics and the Global Water Crisis</i>, will speak on the intersection 
between our faith and the increasing problem of lack of access to water in many 
areas of the world. Monday, June 8, 2009, 7:00 pm in the Pastoral Outreach

<p><b>SUMMER FILM FESTIVAL</b>. Join us on 2nd Tuesdays of
the summer months in Cathedral Place, 2nd floor at
7:00pm for the return of this popular summer series.
Popcorn and lemonade will be provided and you are
welcome to bring your favorite treats. First showing:
<i>The Visitor</i> (PG-13) on Tuesday, June 9. The film is
about an American professor and an immigrant family
from Syria, and explores the effects of our immigration
and detention system on the lives of immigrants. It has

Program. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>THE NEXT SENIOR TRIP</b> will be Wednesday, June 10,
the Point Defiance Zoo. This zoo is large enough to
offer a wide array of animals yet small enough to
let you get really close to them. You’ll see seahorses
and sharks, peacocks and penguins, wolves and walrus,
all in one place. It offers beautiful views of Puget Sound, Mount Rainier and 
the Olympic Mountains, too. Space is limited and priority will be
given to registered parishioners! <i>Information, or to
reserve your place</i>,

Pastoral Care Minister, at 206-274-3173.</p>
<p><b>HELP A SENIOR IN NEED</b>. Many in our community
are in need of help with transportation, shopping,
laundry, housework, and more. Age, illness,
economics, and disabilities can all be barriers to
accomplishing these routine, daily tasks. By
volunteering just a few hours a month, you can
make a huge difference in someone’s life, provide
them peace of mind, and help them to stay in their
own home rather than going to an institutionalized
setting. If you are interested in joining this
rewarding ministry, please come to the orientation
on the 2nd floor of the Pastoral Outreach Center on
Wednesday, June 10 at 6:30pm. <i>Information</i>

		<p>“Annual Catholic Appeal” season is drawing to a close.
But as you can see, we’re not quite there yet. <b>We are
about $30,000 short of our goal!</b> Every dollar that comes
in now will be returned to the parish in the
form of a rebate to support our Cathedral
Kitchen and other outreach ministries. This
isn’t just a “bonus”—these are funds we
actually rely on to make these important
ministries happen. Your support at this
time is <i>crucial</i>!</p>
