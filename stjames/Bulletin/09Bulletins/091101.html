<p><b>LET YOUR PRESENCE BE A PRESENT TO SOMEONE
IN NEED</b>. During times of personal crisis, in addition
to practical services, people often need the caring

listen. The Solanus Casey Center, a program of St.
James Cathedral and Catholic Community Services,
seeks to provide that listening ear, as well as
referrals and limited assistance, to those in need in
our community. The Center is currently in need of a
few kind volunteers who can help one day a week
from 12:45pm-4:15pm. Training is
available. <i>Information</i>,

generous donations of St. James parishioners. Please drop off any of the 
following unused items in the blue bin at coffee hour: disposable razors, cough 
drops, individually wrapped toothbrushes and travel-sized toothpaste. <i>Information</i>, Denise Carlascio, 425-687-7495.</p>
