    ELECT</font></p>
    <p>Beginning this week, our newly Elect are wearing brown robes while attending Mass and
    other liturgies during Lent. This helps them to know, in a concrete way, that they have
    entered a new and significant stage in their final preparations for Easter. It also
    anticipates another change that will take place when they emerge from the baptismal waters
    at the Easter Vigil and change to white robes. Seek them out in our midst and, if
    possible, introduce yourself to them after Mass. Let them know you are praying for them
    and looking forward to Easter when they will join us at the Eucharistic table.</p>
    <p><b>LENTEN PRAYER PARTNERS FOR THE ELECT</b>. The Church tells us that it is the entire
    parish&#146;s responsibility to support and welcome those preparing for baptism this
    Easter. One of the many ways you can do this is to become a prayer partner for one of our
    Elect. You are asked to pray everyday for him/her during Lent, asking for God&#146;s
    blessings and guidance. Also, notes and cards will be collected during Holy Week to be
    given to the Elect before Easter. Prayer cards are available at the place of prayer
    located in the north aisle of the west nave of the Cathedral, in the bookstore, and in
    Cathedral Hall during Sunday morning hospitality. You can also meet our Elect by going to
    our <a href="../../Events/2009/elect2009.htm">parish website</a>. Your prayers make a
    difference! <i>Information</i>, <a

<p><b>WELCOME, PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN</b>. We support all of our parishioners who are
attending Mass with young children and we welcome those children into our midst. If you
find that your child needs a quiet place away from the stimulation of the Mass, please
feel free to step into the west vestibule or the cathedral chapel, where we have provided
a sound system so that you can continue to participate in the Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our worship. <i>Please note that
babysitting is available in the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach Center during

<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST. JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James
regularly and consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially registered. <i>We
strongly encourage you to register</i>. Registered parishioners receive important mailings
from the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are regular recipients of the
Cathedral&#146;s journal <i>In Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate their wedding at the
Cathedral, and their children may attend any of the five Catholic Rainbow Schools at
parishioner rates (and become eligible for Cathedral scholarship money). In addition, if
you are a registered parishioner and use envelopes, or are on the direct deposit program,
we will mail you a quarterly report of your contributions to the parish. Registration
cards can be found in the kiosk in Cathedral Hall. <i>If you&#146;re not sure whether
you&#146;re registered at St. James, call the parish office at 206-622-3559</i>.</p>

    height="126" align="right">During this Lenten Season Catholic Relief Services invites us
    to journey in solidarity with our global family through Operation Rice Bowl. Donations
    collected in your Rice Bowl go to poor countries around the world to fund development
    projects&#151;agriculture, water, education, microfinance&#151;that help communities break
    free of hunger. Operation Rice Bowl collects money for Catholic Relief Services, the
    official aid agency of the US Catholic Church, who then distributes the money to local
    Catholic charities and other small community agencies who make a big difference in their
    communities. What comes out of the Rice Bowl is as important as what goes into it. In each
    folded-up cardboard bowl is a calendar with a prayer, reflection, fact, or action for
    every day of Lent, all based on Catholic Social Teaching. Each week the calendar invites
    you to fast in solidarity with the poor around the world, using a simple meal from the
    &quot;developing&quot; world. What goes into the bowl is your help to people around the
    world who face hunger and rising food prices. What comes out of the bowl is a way to walk
    through Lent in deeper solidarity with the whole human family... It is a journey of
    prayer, fasting, learning and giving, all with an international flavor.</td>
