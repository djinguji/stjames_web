<p><b>WELCOME:</b> If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know how welcome
you are &#150; whether you have come from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church&#146;s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a wide range of services to
needy people living in the central district of our city. </p>
<p><b>NEW IN THE BOOKSTORE</b>. Stop by the Cathedral
Bookstore today for a wide variety of Lenten reading,
including daily meditations by Henri Nouwen, Thomas
Merton, G. K. Chesterton, and many more.</p>
<p><b>LENTEN HOLY HOURS</b>. Each Friday during Lent, join
in a special Lenten Holy Hour beginning at 12 Noon.
With Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament, Liturgy of
the Hours, Rosary, and time for silence, Holy Hour is
the perfect Lenten retreat for the end of a busy week.</p>
<p><b>STATIONS OF THE CROSS DURING LENT</b>. There are three opportunities to 
pray the Stations each week: on Mondays following 12:10pm Midday Prayer, 
Wednesdays following the 5:30 pm Mass, and Fridays following the 8:15am Mass 
(except on First Fridays). On Sunday, March 15, following the Noon Mass, the 
children of the Cathedral will pray the Stations with Father Ryan.</p>
<p><b>A LENTEN BIBLE STUDY&#8230;ST. PAUL&#8217;S LETTER TO
THE ROMANS</b>. Tuesdays, 1:00 -3:00pm or 7:00 -
9:00pm, Cathedral Place, second floor. We complete
our two year review of the writings of St. Paul by
studying his letter to the Romans&#8212;the most
compelling and challenging of all his letters. All are
welcome and no bible experience required! (<i>This
Week: Salvation and the Christian Life</i> &#8212; <i>6:1&#8211;8:39</i>)</p>

vulnerable children affected by HIV and AIDS. Let
us accept the challenge of Operation Rice Bowl: to
pray that we overcome indifference to the needs of
others; to fast in solidarity with those who are hungry
by eating simply; to learn about the needs of the
poor, and to give money saved by fasting and eating
simply to Operation Rice Bowl.</td>

weekend we celebrate the
first of the three Scrutinies and
the retelling of the story of the
Samaritan woman at the well.
This Gospel challenges our Elect
to be honest about their personal lives just was the
woman was with her encounter with Christ. In
acknowledging their sinfulness and need for
healing, they come to know more fully the mercy
and loving acceptance of Christ in their lives. To
prepare for their Scrutiny, each is asked to reflect
upon what he/she most thirsts for in life, and then to
bring that to this ancient rite for God&#8217;s grace.
Continue to enter into these solemn rites in prayer
with our Elect as they prepare for baptism.</p>

<p><b>HELP A SENIOR IN NEED</b>. Many in our community are
in need of help with transportation, shopping, laundry,
housework, and more. Age, illness, economics, and
disabilities can all be barriers to accomplishing these
routine, daily tasks. By volunteering just a few hours a
month, you can make a huge difference in someone&#8217;s
life and provide them peace of mind and the option to
stay in their own home rather than going to an
institutionalized setting. If you are interested in joining
this rewarding ministry, please come to the orientation
on the 2nd floor of the Pastoral Outreach Center on
Tuesday, March 31 at 6:30pm. <i>Information</i>

<p><b>LENTEN BLOOD DRIVE</b>. There were 34 participants in
the Lenten Blood Drive, a great success for a tradition
that is only four years old at St. James. The Health and
Healing Ministry extends a grateful thank-you to all
who participated. You are meeting a great need in our
larger community; your donation is helping to save a
life. As St James has proven to be a very giving
community, look for information toward the end of
summer on our Fall Blood Drive.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME, PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN</b>. We
support all of our parishioners who are attending Mass
with young children and we welcome those children
into our midst. If you find that your child needs a quiet
place away from the stimulation of the Mass, please
feel free to step into the west vestibule or the cathedral
chapel, where we have provided a sound system so
that you can continue to participate in the Mass. We
appreciate your effort to be with us and to include
your child in our worship.</p>

<p><i>Please note that babysitting is available in the Mother
Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach Center during
the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses</i>.</p>

<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never
officially registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to
register</i>. Registered parishioners receive important
mailings from the Cathedral (including offering
envelopes!), are regular recipients of the Cathedral&#8217;s
quarterly journal <i>In Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate
their wedding at the Cathedral, and their children may
attend any of the five Catholic Rainbow Schools at
parishioner rates (and become eligible for Cathedral
scholarship money). In addition, if you are a registered
parishioner and use envelopes, or are on the direct
debit program, we will mail you a quarterly report of
your contributions to the parish. Registration cards can
be found in the vestibule. Please drop the completed
card in the collection basket or put it in the mail. <i>If

James, call the parish office at 206-622-3559</i>.</p>

    <p>We are the cathedral for the Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle and its Archbishop, The
    Most Reverend Alexander J. Brunett. We are also a parish church for a vibrant faith
    community with a long history that reaches back to Seattle&#146;s early days. </p>
    <p>We are an inner-city parish with an outreach to many who live on the edge of poverty
    and loneliness. We are a diverse community that welcomes, accepts, and celebrates the
    differences we all bring. We exist in the heart of the city, yet sometimes our
    parishioners come from considerable distances to worship here. </p>
    <p>St. James Cathedral is a crossroads where ideas and challenges both old and new are
    explored in the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. </p>
    <p>Our cathedral is also the center for many cultural and ecumenical events which both
    reflect and help to shape the fabric of a vital metropolitan community. </p>
    <p>Above all, St. James Cathedral is a community of prayer. </p>
