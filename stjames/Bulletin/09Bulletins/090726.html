<p><b>From the Pastor&#146;s Desk</b></p>
<p>July 19, 2009</p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>For some of you, this will be the first time you will have heard of the death of
Deacon Joe Curtis. Joe died very suddenly and unexpectedly in the wee hours of last
Tuesday morning. I had visited him late Sunday afternoon over at Exeter House and
would never have guessed that his death was so near. He was looking forward to
returning to his home at Faerland Terrace and, even more importantly, to his
community here at St. James.</p>
<p>For personal reasons, Joe’s family was very eager to have his funeral as soon
as possible. It was celebrated this past Thursday afternoon. Many of you learned
about it in time to attend but many others of you, unfortunately, did not. For that
reason, I intend to offer the 10:00 Mass next Sunday, the feast of St. James, for the
happy repose of his soul.</p>
<p>Joe Curtis joined our staff as minister with the homeless back in the late 1980’s
– just a year or so after I arrived at St. James. His name quickly became synonymous
with the Cathedral’s outreach to poor and homeless people in downtown Seattle.
More importantly, his presence became a gift to countless people who call the streets
of our city home. Joe was a founder of the Matt Talbot Center, he led Bible study
sessions at the Downtown Emergency Service Center, for years he coordinated the
parish’s involvement in Operation Nightwatch, and he ran the clothing room at the
Lazarus Day Center. Very fittingly, in 2003 he was honored by Operation
Nightwatch as Hero of the Homeless.</p>
<p>And, of course, Joe served as Deacon and preached here at St. James. All
those years he did what deacons are ordained to do: he helped awaken us to what it
means to find the face of Christ in the least of our sisters and brothers. In so many
ways, he was “in our midst as one who serves.”</p>
<p>We will miss Joe but we will see him again when the mercy of God gathers us
together gain in the joy of God’s kingdom! Please pray for him as well as for his
wife, Martha, and his daughters Ann and Mary and their families.</p>
