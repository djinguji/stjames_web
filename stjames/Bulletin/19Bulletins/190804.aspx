<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from Gina De Savia in
memory of her father Philip on the second anniversary of
his death. <i>Floral offerings are a wonderful way to
remember a deceased loved one, celebrate an
anniversary, or give thanks for a prayer that has been
answered. We currently have many weekends open for
floral offerings, including Sundays, August 18, August
25, September 1, and September 15, 22, and 29.
Information,

<p><b>THANK YOU, FATHER OHNO</b>. For many years now, we
have been blessed by the ministry of Father Ignatius
(“Natch”) Ohno, SJ, who has assisted regularly on
weekdays, at penance services, and the occasional
weekend as well. His gentle presence and wise words
have touched many of us through the years. On July 31,
the Feast of St. Ignatius, Father Ohno was appointed
Rector of the Jesuit Community at Bellarmine High
School in Tacoma. We congratulate him and will miss
him! Father Ohno’s last regular Mass with us will be on
Tuesday, August 6 at 5:30pm. We will send him off with
a special blessing. All are welcome.</p>
<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
One kilogram of clothing over its entire life cycle creates
11 kilograms of greenhouse gases. Buying used clothes
and donating ones you are no longer using keeps those
materials out of landfills. For back-to-school, think about
resale stores to save money and extend the life of
clothes.</p>

	<p><b>IMMIGRATION VIGIL</b>. On Thursday, August 8 at 5:30pm,
St. James Cathedral will host a special Mass in response
to the immigration crisis at our borders. As fear and
xenophobia rise, many of our brothers and sisters live in
fear of ICE raids and family separation. This is an
opportunity to come together in prayerful solidarity for
those who are suffering, and to pray that our nation may
respond with compassion to those who come to our
borders fleeing poverty and violence. The Mass will
conclude with the lighting of candles. Auxiliary Bishop Eusebio Elizondo will preside. All are welcome.</p>
<p><b>SEEKING AUCTION DONATIONS</b>. The Hunthausen Golf Tournament is just a 
few weeks away (Monday, August 26) and we are seeking items for our silent 
auction benefiting the Cathedral Kitchen. Gift cards of all kinds are welcome 
(consider picking up a gift card or two at Costco or wherever you shop), along 
with bottles of wine or spirits, and event tickets (theatre, sports, etc). Gift 
cards of any value ($5 and up!) are welcome. Would you be able to donate 
something? <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>CATHEDRAL CHOIR & WOMEN’S SCHOLA AUDITIONS</b>.
Music Director Joseph Adam will be holding auditions
over the summer for membership in the Cathedral
Choir and the Women of St. James Schola. Cathedral
Choir singers must have a good comfort level of
reading music, attend Thursday night rehearsals, and
sing at the Sunday 10:00am Mass and other liturgical
events. The Women of St. James Schola come from
many musical backgrounds and skill levels, and meet
at 4:00pm on Sundays to sing for 5:30pm Mass.
Schola repertoire includes unison chant and 2-3 part motets. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN GARDEN NEEDS YOU</b>.
With harvest season right around the corner, we need
more regular volunteers to help maintain the Cathedral
Kitchen Garden! All of our fresh and organic produce
goes toward feeding our food-insecure neighbors at the
Cathedral Kitchen. Come and help us grow!

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
middle-aged man who is slowly rebuilding his life
after a domestic violence incident disrupted his
marriage several years ago. Diagnosed with a mental
disability, he had been living on food stamps and less
than $200 in monthly disability payments from the
state. Something went wrong and the state cut off the
disability payments. He soon received an eviction
notice for failure to pay rent. His case manager helped
him re-apply for disability benefits and told him to call
SVdP for rent help. With your financial support, we paid one month’s rent (only 
$75) to keep him housed in his government-subsidized apartment and gave him a 
$60 grocery store voucher. What a small amount to make such a huge difference in 
this man’s life – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>JOIN THE ST. JAMES WINTER SHELTER TEAM!</b> Even though the City of 
Seattle is moving people into permanent housing, there is still not enough. None 
of us can do it alone to help the thousands in need of housing. The government, 
non-profits, religious institutions and businesses must work together. St. James 
Cathedral offers emergency shelter on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday nights 
from October through April. One of the Corporal Works of Mercy is to Shelter the 
Homeless. If you are available one night a month, please consider joining the 
Winter Shelter team. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>BABYSITTING</b> is available for children up to four years
of age on Sundays during the 10:00am and Noon
Masses, during baptism preparation classes, and during
special events for parents and families. The program is
located in the Mother Cabrini Room on the first floor
of the Pastoral Outreach Center.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we pray for the parishes of St. Mary of the Valley in
Monroe, St. Philomena in Des Moines, and St. Lawrence in
Raymond.</p>
