<p>Dear Friends,</p>
	<p>Not long ago, someone remarked to me about how difficult it is to be
Catholic these days. An understatement, I thought. It seems that scarcely a day
goes by that we are not greeted (assaulted would be the better word) by some new
and shocking revelation that relates to one aspect or another of the sexual abuse
scandal that, for far too long, has been rocking the church—not just in this country,
not just in the developed countries of the world, but seemingly everywhere.</p>
	<p>We are scandalized, disgusted, and weary beyond words. Our hearts ache
for the thousands of victims who carry heavy burdens through their lives. And
while I can’t speak for all of us, I am quite sure that most of us who follow the
news—and who relate day after day to friends, neighbors, and co-workers (and,
often enough, to family members who no longer consider themselves Catholic)&mdash;are finding it increasingly difficult to explain why we continue to identify as
Catholic, why we continue to practice our faith.</p>
	<p>I wish I could provide comfort for you at a profoundly difficult time. I wish
I could provide answers to the questions you are struggling with. I wish I could
reassure you that the worst is over and that things will quiet down soon. I cannot.
All I can do is offer a few considerations that may help provide some context and
some nuance—both of which, when it comes to news reports, seem to be in short
supply.</p>
	<p><b>First, the church, despite all its egregious sins and failings, its fatal
compromises and its deceptions, will weather this storm</b> and, with the grace of
God, become a stronger, more credible, more effective instrument for preaching
the gospel of Jesus Christ. I believe this with all my heart. For this to happen,
however, our bishops must prayerfully listen to God’s Spirit, humbly hear the
cries of God’s people, and resolutely take bold and deliberate steps to root out of
the church every discernible trace of abuse, cover-up, dishonesty, self-deception,
and hypocrisy. Only in this way will a dispirited and deeply wounded church be
able to move forward and carry out its sacred mission.</p>
	<p><b>Not every representation in the secular media regarding these issues can
be taken as gospel</b>. Don’t get me wrong: I am not accusing the secular media of ill
will or deliberate misrepresentation, but we shouldn’t expect secular news sources
to have a carefully nuanced understanding of the church, its life, its history, its
theology, or its canons. I also think it’s true to say that the church has not always
helped the situation: too often it has been far from forthcoming with clear,
complete, transparent, and unbiased information.</p>
	<p><b>Despite what we often hear in news stories, it is not true to say or to
imply that the United States Bishops have not taken serious and significant
steps to deal with the abuse crisis</b>. That they have been slow in doing so is
unarguable, that they have been uneven in their response is also beyond dispute,
but since 2002 when they adopted the so-called Dallas Charter, the bishops have
taken major steps not only to address the sad history of the sexual abuse of
children and vulnerable adults in the church, but also to put into place a set of
policies and protocols to prevent its ever happening again. So, even last summer’s
revelations of the Pennsylvania Grand Jury, lurid and shocking as they were,
should be seen as reports on criminal activity that took place prior to 2002—and
much of it fifty or more years ago. This will bring no comfort to victims, and it
certainly does not in any way excuse past crimes and misdeeds, but it provides
nuance and acknowledges facts that were largely overlooked in much, if not all, of
the reporting. And so, while it is true that before 2002 most, if not all, bishops
made serious errors (sometimes on the basis of flawed advice from mental health
and treatment professionals), it is not fair to overlook the major changes in policy
and practice that have been adopted and implemented, nor is it fair to characterize
all bishops as turning a blind eye, ignoring victims and their families, protecting
offenders, and guarding the church’s reputation at all costs.</p>
	<p><b>The learning curve for dealing with these issues has been long and slow—
too long and too slow</b>. But the same can be said for society in general, including
families, youth organizations, and other churches and institutions, both public and
private. Put simply, society understands these issues much better now than it did
decades ago: for us in the church it means that we have come to realize that the
sexual abuse of children is not just a grave sin, but also a serious crime, and that it
is, in almost every case, treatable but not curable. Some bishops awakened to these
realities rather quickly and took them to heart decades ago; others, sadly, were
slow to act.</p>
	<p><b>The church is global</b>. The church exists in countries around the world
where cultural differences are well beyond our experience or comprehension. For
that reason it shouldn’t be too surprising that issues of sexual abuse and cover-up
are not the same everywhere and that only today are we beginning to hear stories
coming out of places like Africa and India. In spite of all our cultural differences,
however, the church must adopt enlightened—and, as far as possible—unified
approaches for dealing with these issues. The current meeting in Rome is an
important step in that direction but only a step, and three days of dialogue,
reflection, and meeting with victims can hardly be expected to heal this longfestering
wound. If, during the meeting, the most important issues are identified,
mistakes owned and repented, and a comprehensive course of action adopted, that
is probably as much as we should expect. For now.</p>
	<p><b>The debate within the church at the present time regarding the causes
underlying sexual abuse is an extremely important one involving very complex
issues</b>. Some would narrow it all down to mandatory celibacy for priests, others
want to blame gays within the priesthood, others the general sexual
permissiveness within our culture, and still others the clerical culture within the
church that places priests on a pedestal and gives them an inordinate amount of
power. I think it is safe to say that, despite claims made by representatives of
various ideological factions within the church, the jury is still out when it comes to
identifying all the causes. My prayer is that this week’s meeting of bishops with
Pope Francis—who is committed to finding solutions and has been very candid
about admitting his own mistakes—will begin a frank discussion of the causes,
and open the way to necessary changes and reforms, no matter how sweeping. I
also hope that those bishops who have made quite clear their opposition to Pope
Francis and his leadership, will set aside polemics and divisiveness and work
together with him to find lasting solutions to the crisis we are facing.</p>
	<p>Let me close with this thought. We will do well to keep in mind that the
church has dealt with grave crises and scandals many times throughout its long
history and, thanks to the guidance of the Holy Spirit and the courageous witness
of saints beyond number, the church has been deepened, purified, and energized.
And I would add that none of the evils we are dealing with—no matter how
grave—is able to undo the immense amount of good that the church, the holy yet
sinful People of God, accomplishes every day in our parishes, ministries, and
institutions here and around the world. We in this parish are witnesses to this
every day—in fact, we are part of it. All of which puts me in mind of a recent
editorial in America magazine, by its editor, Father Matt Malone. He writes: “<i>In any
given hour, on any given day, the news in the church is more good than bad. Much more.
By a magnitude of millions more. That’s because most of the news in the church is the
Good News of Jesus Christ. That’s something we know as people of faith, but it is also
empirically true: Every day millions, billions of people are served by the church, helped and
healed through its sacraments, and accompanied through its social services. Couples
marry, children are baptized, young people are confirmed in their faith, sinners are
forgiven. This is happening right now as you read this in every place the church calls
home</i>.”</p>
	<p>My friends, all of us are committed to the holy mission of the church. In this
most trying of times, may we find strength in our faith, hope for the future, and
the joy that comes from preaching and living the gospel of Christ. I know that you
join me, your fellow parishioners, our bishops, and the entire church in praying
that we will. May it be so!	</p>

middle-aged disabled woman whose only monthly
income is $197 from the state, plus $192 in food
stamps. She pays less than $60 each month for rent,
thanks to a government subsidy paid directly to her
landlord. She is frugal and budgets her money well
enough to get by most months. When one of her two
sisters died recently on the East Coast, she had a florist
send a small bouquet of flowers for the funeral. Paying
for those flowers meant she could not pay her rent. We
helped with the rent and a few other necessities. We
also listened with compassion as she grieved her
sister’s passing and spoke of how much she misses
another East Coast sister who was recently diagnosed
with cancer. Your support for our ministry brings
material aid and spiritual comfort to many in our
parish – thank you! <i>Information</i>,
