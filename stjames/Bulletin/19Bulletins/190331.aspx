<p><b>PRAYING THE STATIONS</b> is a wonderful Lenten

12:10pm Midday Prayer, Wednesdays following the
5:30pm Mass, and Fridays following the 8:15am Mass
(except First Fridays). The unique Stations of the
Cross in the Cathedral are the work of Joan Brand-Landkamer. They were inspired by the work of 20thcentury
French artist Georges Rouault.</p>
<p><b>CHRISM MASS</b>. On Thursday, April 11, at 7:00pm, you
are invited to join Archbishop Sartain and the priests
of the Archdiocese of Seattle for the annual Chrism
Mass, during which oils are blessed for use in the
celebration of the sacraments at the Easter Vigil and

<p><b>MARRIAGE ENRICHMENT DINNER</b>. Did you know the
Church cares about your marriage and wants it to
succeed? And did you know that St. James is
committed to helping married couples live out their
vocation? Good marriages can always be made better!
Pope Francis has described marriage as “a project to
be worked on together” and a “process of
growth” (<i>Amoris Laetitia</i>, no. 218, 221). Marriage
enrichment dinners are an opportunity for couples to
connect with fellow parishioners and to build
community in the process! Married couples of any age
are welcome. Our next gathering is Saturday, April 6,
Pastoral Outreach Center, from 6:30 to 8:30pm.
Babysitting provided. RSVP required. <i>Information and
registration</i>,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
How is your Lenten sacrifice deepening your
relationship with not just yourself but with others, with
God, and with the environment? In this vein, “Giving
up plastic would benefit the common good more than
giving up chocolate,” offers Fr. James Martin, SJ. This
week, consider giving up plastic drinking straws and
plastic shopping bags.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
middle-aged woman who became an alcoholic before
she was a teenager. She spent 40 years struggling to
survive chemical dependency, multiple serious health
issues, physical abuse and homelessness. Her
unquenchable faith in God kept her going, along with
the help of social workers who never lost faith in her.
Now she lives on a small disability income and is a
model tenant in subsidized housing, where she
encourages others to turn their lives around, too. All
she asked of us was help to buy a few clothes and
household items at a SVdP thrift store and hygiene items at a grocery store. 
With your support, we gladly met her needs – thank you! <i>Information</i>,
