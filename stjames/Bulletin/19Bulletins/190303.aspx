<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the

world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Twelve year old Genesis Butler has posed a Lenten
challenge to Pope Francis: Can he go vegan to raise
awareness of how our food and diet adversely affect
animals, people and the environment? Can you take up
her challenge, even for just one or two days a week
during Lent?</p>
<p><b>ASH WEDNESDAY SOUP SUPPER</b>. You are invited to
enjoy a simple soup supper after the 6:00pm Ash
Wednesday Mass in Cathedral Hall.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
middle-aged man struggling to make a living as a driver
for a rideshare car service. Many weeks he pays more to
lease the car than he earns driving it. Until recently he
had no place to park overnight except on the street,
which led to large towing bills on mornings when his
car was still on the the street at the time when “no
parking” rules take effect. His parked car suffered major
damage by a hit-and-run driver, and his insurance
company required him to pay a high deductible for
repairs. After all that, he accidentally dropped his key
ring with all his keys down the elevator shaft at his
apartment building, and the landlord charged a huge fee
to retrieve his keys. At his wits’ end after so much bad
luck and unable to pay his rent, he called SVdP for help. Working with another 
local charity, we paid enough to keep this beleaguered driver housed. Your 
support helps us help our neighbors when bad things happen – thank you! <i>Information</i>,
