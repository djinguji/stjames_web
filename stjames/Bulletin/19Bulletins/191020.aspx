<p><b>REPORT FROM ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b>. Your SVdP
donations made it possible for our Cathedral
Vincentians to do 144 home visits during July, August
& September and help 294 low (or no) income
residents of St James parish who struggle to pay for
life's necessities, such as rent, electricity, beds, food,
clothes and basic hygiene products. Your generosity is
great, but we continue to be asked for more help than
we can provide, especially with the high rents in
central Seattle. That means we and those we serve are
deeply grateful for every dollar you share with SVdP – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>NIGHTWATCHERS NEEDED</b>. On Second Sundays of
every month, a team of St. James volunteers serve the
evening meal at Operation Nightwatch. This dinner is
one of the latest of the day, meaning that it is often the
only place where food-insecure people who work into
the evening can get a hot meal. Right now, our team is
desperately understaffed, and we are in urgent need of
servers. If you have one free evening a month, please
consider volunteering for this important ministry.

<p>“All too often, as we know from experience, people do not choose life, they 
do not accept the ‘Gospel of Life’ but let themselves be led by ideologies and 
ways of thinking that block life, that do not respect life, because they are 
dictated by selfishness, selfinterest,
profit, power and pleasure, and not by
love, by concern for the good of others…As a
result, the living God is replaced by fleeting
human idols which offer the intoxication of a flash
of freedom, but in the end bring new forms of
slavery and death.” (Pope Francis, from homily at
Mass for ‘Evangelium Vitae Day’ June 16, 2013)</p>
