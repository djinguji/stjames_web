<p><b>LAUDATO SI’ REGIONAL GATHERING</b> Tuesday, July 9,
11am-2pm. Holy Names Room, Pastoral Outreach
Center. In <i>Laudato Si’, On Care for Our Common
Home</i>, Pope Francis calls for “a conversation which includes everyone, since 
the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and 
affect us all.” Catholic parishes and institutions are invited to learn from one 
another, and to strategize ways that we can take action on behalf of our Sister, 
Mother Earth. The day will include opportunities for prayer through an 
ecological spirituality, for local Catholics to share updates on local and 
national endeavors, for parishes and institutions to look ahead to the future, 
and for the emergence of new partnerships and networking, all on behalf of our 
common home. At the end of the day, each attendee should be educated, inspired 
and motivated with a deeper reverence and respect for God’s Creation. <i>Information and registration</i>,
