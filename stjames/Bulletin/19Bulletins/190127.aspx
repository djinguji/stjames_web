<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
At this year’s World Youth Day in Panama, a manifesto
announced that “Young people want to focus on
‘achieving 100% renewable energy, to put an end to the
era of fossil fuels’ in line with the goal of the Paris
agreement to limit global warming to 1.5° C”.</p>
<p><b>POWERFUL TOOLS FOR CAREGIVERS</b>. Do you
support an adult family member with a chronic
condition? In this free 6-week course, learn key skills
for taking care of yourself while you care for your
loved one. Topics include stress reduction,

<p><b>BABYSITTERS NEEDED</b>. St. James Cathedral offers
babysitting for children ages 1-4 during the 10 am and
12:00pm Sunday Masses, during baptism preparation
classes, and for special events. Two paid babysitters,
who are over the age of 18 and have gone through Safe
Environment Training, are on duty at all times. We
currently have openings for additional staff. If you like
working with children and want to provide a valuable
service to the young families of our parish, please
apply. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>VAN DRIVERS NEEDED</b>. Our Sunday van ministry is an
important outreach to senior parishioners who would
not be able to get to 10:00am Mass on Sunday if it
weren’t for our drivers. It’s a simple but important way
to reach out to some of our senior parishioners! Right
now we have a need for just one driver on the third
Sunday of the month. All training provided;
background check required. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Several years ago,
we visited a lively woman with a passionate hobby:
using her microscope to explore the microbiology of
her apartment building. We did not know whether to
laugh or cry as she described in vivid detail how scary
dust from the building’s hallways and elevators looked
under her microscope. Recently we visited again. She
now has memory issues, and the microscope is tucked
away, collecting its own dust. To overcome her failing
memory, she asked her bank to pay her monthly rent
automatically. The bank’s payment system failed, and
her rent went unpaid for months. Unaware of the
problem, she thought she had “extra money” in the
bank, which she spent on extra things, until she got an
eviction notice. Bank and landlord then set up
safeguards to avoid this happening again. Your
donations allowed SVdP to pay enough of the unpaid
rent to keep this sweet woman housed and put a smile
back on her face. Thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>NEW! TAI CHI CLASSES</b> at St. James Cathedral,
Fridays from 4–5pm, beginning February 8, Pastoral
Outreach Center. Tai chi is often described as
"meditation in motion," but it might well be called
"medication in motion." There is growing evidence
that this mind-body practice, which originated in
China as a martial art, has value in treating or
preventing many health problems. And you can get
started even if you aren't in top shape or the best of
health. Classes are for all ages and all levels of fitness.
Seniors are welcomed! <i>Information</i>,
