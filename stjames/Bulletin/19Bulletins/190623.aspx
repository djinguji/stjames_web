<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the

world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person

<p><b>CORPUS CHRISTI PROCESSION</b>. Today, Sunday, June
23, we will have the traditional procession with the
Blessed Sacrament at the end of the 10:00am Mass. It is
a joyful and festive celebration with choirs and bagpipes
as we bring our faith to the streets. Pope Francis has
said, “At the end of Mass, we too will go out; we will go
forth with Jesus, who will pass through the streets of
this city. Jesus wants to dwell among you. Let us open
our doors to him and say: Come, Lord, and visit us. We
welcome you into our hearts, our families and our city.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>THURSDAY EVENING ADORATION</b>. Immediately
following the 5:30pm Mass on Thursday evenings, all
are invited to a time of quiet prayer and adoration with
Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament.</p>
<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Think reusable, not disposable! Use recyclable or
reusable bottles. Over 500 BILLION plastic bottles are
used every year around the world.</p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited an elderly mom who happened 
to witness a domestic violence incident between a man and his wife in a public 
place. Although just a bystander, mom was physically attacked during the fracas. 
Her adult son was nearby and intervened to rescue his mom. When police arrived, 
her son was among those arrested. Mom used her rent money to bail him out of 
jail. Luckily, her landlord was understanding and did not threaten to evict. But 
mom, living on a small Social Security retirement income, needed our help. With 
your financial support, we paid enough rent to make it possible for her pay the 
remaining balance over time – thank you!
