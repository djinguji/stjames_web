<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A young musician
was in a terrible vehicle accident that caused serious
physical injuries and mental problems, including
chronic memory loss and confusion. His injuries made
it impossible for him to work for at least nine months.
Overly optimistic that his attorney could “quickly”
negotiate settlements with insurance companies
representing the other driver and a medical provider
who may have committed malpractice in treating him,
he fell behind on rent. He called the SVdP Helpline (206-767-6449) only after 
his landlord threatened eviction. Your support allowed us to give just enough 
help to avoid eviction until his settlement money could arrive – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p>“Our defense of the innocent unborn... needs to be clear, firm and 
passionate, for at stake is the dignity of a human life, which is always sacred 
and demands love for each person, regardless of his or her stage of development. 
Equally sacred, however, are the lives of the poor, those already born, the 
destitute, the abandoned and the underprivileged, the vulnerable infirm and 
elderly exposed to covert euthanasia, the victims of human trafficking, new 
forms of slavery, and every form of rejection.” (Pope Francis, <i>Gaudete et Exsultate</i>, 84)</p>
