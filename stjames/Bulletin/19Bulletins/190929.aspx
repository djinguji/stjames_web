<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL INVITES YOU</b>.
to explore
volunteering with us. Our Cathedral Vincentians help
parish residents in need of financial aid for rent and
some of life’s other necessities. We deliver our help
through friendly, nonjudgmental visits to homes of our
neighbors in need. Are you a patient listener with
compassion for others who are struggling? Then come
join us on God’s frontline, where we witness His
blessings unfold in “ordinary” lives made
extraordinary by His love. We meet as a group at St
James for 90 minutes on two Tuesday evenings each
month. Our active members also do home visits
(always in pairs) one or more times per month, each
time taking 2-3 hours to complete the visits. Please ask
us your questions, and we will share more details.
