<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>ADVENT CELEBRATION AT TODAY’S COFFEE HOUR</b>.
We’re serving a hearty breakfast after the 8am Mass this
morning, with bread pudding and fruit along with our
usual coffee and orange juice. After the 10:00am and
Noon Masses, join us for Christmas cookies and hot
cocoa!</p>
<p><b>CHRISTMAS CROWDS</b>. Parishioners, please note that the
Christmas Eve Masses tend to be very crowded, with
almost as many people standing as sitting at the 5:30pm
Vigil and 10:00pm Masses. Let’s be as welcoming as
possible to our guests and visitors during the coming
holy days! If you prefer not to brave the crowds (and to
keep your usual seat!), consider attending one of our
Christmas Day Masses, especially the 8:00am, 10:00am
or the 5:30pm on Tuesday, December 25.</p>
<p><b>CHRISTMAS EVE GREETERS NEEDED</b>. Each year,
nearly four thousand parishioners and visitors come to
the Cathedral on Christmas Eve! We need your help to
extend a warm welcome to every one of them. Please
consider volunteering as a greeter to provide hospitality,
answer basic questions, and hand out programs.
Greeters get reserved seats for the Mass. We need
greeters for both the 5:30pm Mass (arrive by 4:00pm)
and the 10:00pm Mass (arrive by 7:45pm). Please
contact

<p><b>THE SOLEMNITY OF THE DEDICATION</b> will be Friday,
December 21 at the 5:30pm Mass. St. James Cathedral
was dedicated on December 22, 1907. It was
rededicated on December 22, 1994 following an
extensive restoration and renovation. Each year, this
anniversary is observed as a solemnity in the Cathedral.
The Mass includes a procession with the lighting of the
dedication candles. All are welcome!</p>
<p><b>GREENING OF THE CATHEDRAL</b>. On Friday, December
21 at 6:15pm, Cathedral Young Adults are invited to
help decorate the Cathedral for Christmas. This is a
fun evening for anyone in their 20’s or 30’s to come
together to make the Cathedral even more beautiful for
the Christmas season. We’ll start with pizza and cider
and then head over to the Cathedral. This is a favorite
event for young adults—we hope you can join us!
RSVP required. <i>Information or to RSVP</i>,

<p><b>SENIOR CHRISTMAS SOCIAL</b>. Mark your calendar for
the Senior Christmas Social on Thursday, December
20, 1:00–3:00 pm, Pastoral Outreach Center. Ms. Selina Chu, St. James parishioner and accomplished
pianist, is back by popular demand and will spread her
unique Christmas warmth and cheer with joyful

understand their condition and journey toward recovery.
Taught by a trained team of people who’ve been there, the
program includes presentations, discussion, and interactive
exercises. Everything is confidential and NAMI never
recommends a specific medical therapy or treatment
approach. “It made me feel I was not alone in coping with
mental illness. It gave me hope that I could recover and
that my life would not always be filled with chaos and it
gave me positive role models to inspire me to strive for
recuperation and success in life”. RSVP to

<p align="center">Lord, when you came among us,<br/>
a star was seen in the heavens –<br/>
but only by those who looked.<br/>
A choir of angels was heard –<br/>
but only by those who listened.<br/>

no cataclysm announced you,<br/>

turning to everyone, saying,<br/>
“will you let me in?”</p>

and every town is Bethlehem,<br/>
and every inn seems filled,<br/>

may we have ears to hear the choir,<br/>
may we have hearts that finally speak.<br/>
Emmanuel, the Christmas promise,<br/>
light in each of us the courage<br/>
to walk along with the sojourner and stranger<br/>
as sister and brother,<br/>
welcoming as we too long to be welcomed,<br/>
truly family on a shared journey toward<br/>
Your loving embrace. Amen.</p>
