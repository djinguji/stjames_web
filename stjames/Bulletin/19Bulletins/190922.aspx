<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
During this Season of Creation, Pope Francis
underlines that “this is the season for letting our prayer
be inspired anew by closeness to nature, which
spontaneously leads us to give thanks to God the
Creator.” Our prayers and appeals, he says, “are
directed first at raising the awareness of political and
civil leaders”, especially those governments “that will
meet in the coming months to renew commitments
decisive for directing the planet towards life, not
death.”</p>
<p><b>THURSDAY EVENING ADORATION</b>. Immediately
following the 5:30pm Mass on Thursday evenings, all
are invited to a time of quiet prayer and adoration with
Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament.</p>
