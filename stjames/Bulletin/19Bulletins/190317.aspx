often surrounds mental illness. You will gain the
experience of prayer, supportive relationships,
discovering your inner strengths and learning
how to identify local resources that can offer
additional support if needed. The group is offered
on the first Sunday of the month, April 7, and
May 5. <i>Information</i>,
