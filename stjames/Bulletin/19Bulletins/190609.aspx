<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the

Archdiocese. For more information about the parish,

Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a young
woman with serious, chronic health issues that make it
impossible for her to work. She had just moved from a
homeless shelter into an apartment near the medical
center where she regularly receives treatment. Her only
monthly income is a small (under $200) state disability
payment and food stamps, and her partner had barely
started work as an entry-level pizza cook. They were
sleeping on the floor. We gave them a bed, helped with
rent and referred them to other charities that can provide
free food, clothing and household items. Your financial
support made our help possible – thank you!
