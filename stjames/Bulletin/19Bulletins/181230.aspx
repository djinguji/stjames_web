Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person

COUNT US IN</b>. St. James will
participate in the annual count of
people experiencing homelessness
in the early hours of the morning of
January 25, 2019. The purpose of
the Count is to collect data on the
needs of people experiencing
homelessness in our community.
The count also provides an
excellent opportunity to increase awareness of
homelessness and to spark action. Register at 
<a target="_bulletin" href="https://kingcounty.pointintime.info/register.cfm">https://kingcounty.pointintime.info/register.cfm</a> and be sure
to indicate that you want to join the St. James
Cathedral team. It is also good to notify 
<a href="mailto:pbarredo@stjames-cathedral.org?subject=Count Us In">Patrick Barredo</a> 
(206-382-4515) that you have registered.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A young man
who had just moved into an apartment after an
extended period of homelessness asked SVdP for a
bed, sheets and other household items. Two of us were
on our way to visit him when he called with the good
news that he did not need our help. Several of his
family members had surprised him with a visit of their
own, delivering to his apartment everything he had
asked us for and more. What made him happiest was
that his family told him they were proud of him for
getting out of homelessness and some “bad places” he
had been in his earlier life. We congratulated him on
this happy news and asked him to thank his family for
us as their help to him meant we could put your
donations to work helping someone else instead –
thank you! <i>Information</i>,
