<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>The announcement this past week that Pope Francis has appointed Archbishop
Paul Etienne (pronounced &#256;-chen), Archbishop of Anchorage, as coadjutor archbishop for
the Archdiocese of Seattle, came quite unexpectedly. As coadjutor, Archbishop Etienne
will become the Archbishop of Seattle when Archbishop Sartain retires.</p>
<p>This past Monday, Archbishop Sartain explained in a letter to the people of the
archdiocese his reasons for asking Pope Francis to appoint a coadjutor. As you can
imagine, the decision to do so was made only after months of prayerful soul-searching
and discernment, and it was made for reasons of health. Archbishop Sartain has
undergone a number of very serious spinal injuries over the past several years and
although the surgeries, particularly the last one, brought him significant relief, they left
him with some disabling complications including a significant loss of the kind of energy
and stamina needed in order to carry out his daunting responsibilities. In the end, in
fairness to the people of the archdiocese, he felt the right thing would be to retire early.</p>
<p>In typically gracious fashion, Archbishop Sartain has welcomed the appointment
of Archbishop Etienne, calling him “a wonderful shepherd whose love for the Lord is
expressed through a deep life of prayer and devotion to the sacraments, as well as
contagious enthusiasm for the proclamation of the Gospel and service to those in need.”</p>
<p>I had the opportunity last Monday to meet Archbishop Etienne and to give him a
tour of the Cathedral. He’s a warm and gracious man—kind, good-humored, rooted in
God, a true servant of the Gospel, in love with God’s people. And, you’ll be happy to
know that it didn’t take him long at all to realize what a beautiful Cathedral we have!</p>
<p>Archbishop Etienne will be formally welcomed and installed as coadjutor
archbishop at a Mass here in the Cathedral on Friday, June 7, at 2:00 in the afternoon.
Then, sometime down the road, at a time yet to be determined, Archbishop Sartain will
turn over the reins to him as his successor.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I know you will join me in praying for Archbishop Sartain. His
presence here and his ministry over the past nine years have been a singular blessing for
this local church and for this Cathedral. Speaking personally, I have been especially
blessed in the warm and fraternal relationship we have enjoyed. Please pray for him as he
completes his loving ministry in our midst, and pray, too, for his peace as he looks to the
future.</p>
<p>And please pray for Archbishop Etienne as he prepares to begin his ministry here
among us. Even though he has expressed genuine excitement about it, this must be a
bittersweet moment for him as he leaves Anchorage, and I’m sure he will be deeply
grateful for the support of your prayers.</p>
