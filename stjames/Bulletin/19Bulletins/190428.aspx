world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral

<p><b>REPORT FROM ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b>. Your SVdP
donations made it possible for our Cathedral Vincentians
to do 136 home visits during January, February &
March and help 176 low (or no) income residents of St
James parish who struggle to pay for life's necessities,
such as rent, electricity, beds, food, clothes and basic
hygiene products. Your generosity is great, but we
continue to be asked for more help than we can provide,
especially with the high rents in central Seattle. That
means we and those we serve are deeply grateful for
every dollar you share with SVdP – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

Resurrection to a world in need. You can still turn in
your Rice Bowl. Please convert your CRS Rice Bowl
gifts into checks made out to St. James Cathedral for
easier counting, be sure to write “CRS Rice Bowl” on
the memo line, and then place your gift into the
collection basket at Mass. You may also donate
directly to Catholic Relief Services at
<a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.crsricebowl.org/give">www.crsricebowl.org/give</a>. And did you know that

support the Cathedral Garden, which provides fresh
produce for the Cathedral Kitchen!</p>

	<p><b>MAY IS MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH</b>, a time
to pray, support and fight stigma for people affected by
mental illness and their families in our parish, city and
country. Did you know…</p>
<ul>
	<li>1 in 5 adults in the United States lives with a mental
health condition and 1 in 25 adults lives with a
serious mental illness</li>
<li>Half of all lifelong mental health conditions begin
by age 14 and 75% by age 24, but early intervention
can help</li>
	<li>No fewer than 4 youth in King County have died by
suicide in April. 90% of those who take their own
lives have an underlying mental illness. Suicide is
the 10th leading cause of death in the United States
and rates for suicide in youth are increasing at an
alarming rate. Suicide is preventable.</li>
<li>Today’s treatments for serious mental illnesses are
highly effective; between 70-90% of individuals
have significant reduction of symptoms and
improved quality of life with the right help and
supports.</li>
