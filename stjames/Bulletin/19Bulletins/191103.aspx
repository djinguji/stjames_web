<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how

from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
young woman who attends college fulltime while also
working fulltime. Her well-paying job at a local
hospital had allowed her to keep up with tuition and
living expenses. Suddenly she lost her job in a round of
layoffs. She soon found work cleaning houses 35-40
hours per week, but her hourly wage was much lower.
She could not pay her rent and, when she missed a rent
payment, her landlord imposed high late fees that
increased daily. She used up all her savings and then
called SVdP for help. We paid enough rent to allow her
to stay in the apartment while she sought a cheaper
place to live. Your donations made it possible for this
hard-working young woman to keep a roof over her
head and stay in college – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

listening device to use whenever you come to Mass, please contact
