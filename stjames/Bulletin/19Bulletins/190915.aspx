	<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a young man who works 
	for a local nonprofit that helps the homeless in Seattle. In his job, he 
	walks many of the streets downtown in the late evenings, seeking homeless 
	persons who need help. We were deeply moved by his gentleness and the way he 
	spoke about his faith in Christ as motivation for his personal ministry to 
	the poor. He needed help with rent and, because of your donations, it was 
	our privilege to be able to help – thank you! <i>Information</i>,
