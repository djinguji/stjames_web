<p><i>This letter was in last Sunday’s bulletin, but I thought it was important to include it
this week since so many of you were unable to be here last weekend.</i></p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
	<p>You will no doubt notice that the crucifix hanging near the altar of the
Cathedral is not the one you are used to. It saddens me to have to tell you
that that crucifix was severely damaged some days ago when a deranged
person managed to get behind it and send it crashing to the floor. We have
been told by a skilled art conservator that she will be able to restore it but
that it will most likely take many months to do so. I find this reassuring
because the crucifix is beloved of many and has been in the Cathedral for 70
years. Since the renovation of 1994 it has not only stood near the altar but
has led many a procession into the Cathedral on great feasts and
solemnities.
</p>
<p>The beautiful icon cross that now hangs in its place is the work of our
Cathedral iconographer, Joan Brand-Landkamer, whose icons regularly
grace our liturgical celebrations. Over the years, Joan has written upwards
of 40 icons for the Cathedral.
</p>
<p>A mindless act of destruction is heart-breaking and difficult to
understand. I am hoping in this case that it will prompt you to pray for the
person responsible and to pray for all people who live with the awful
scourge of mental illness.</p>
