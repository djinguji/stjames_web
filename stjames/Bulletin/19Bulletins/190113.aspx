<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are in memory of Ann

also in thanksgiving for all those who will participate in

<p><b>CATHEDRAL MINISTRY CONFERENCE THIS WEEK</b>. You
are invited to participate in several of the Conference
liturgies and events this coming week. Please see the box
in the bulletin for details! The Conference begins with
Evening Prayer on Monday, January 14 at 6:00pm in the
Cathedral. Please note that there will be no 5:30pm Mass
on Monday evening.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
remarkable older woman who has devoted much of her
life to helping others: working in hospice care, sheltering
a woman whose apartment was damaged by fire,
sheltering a man as he received cancer treatments, many
times helping her neighbors in need, taking in rescue
dogs, etc. Disabled by a past brain tumor, she can now
see with only one eye, hear with only one ear and has
memory issues. On top of all that, a bureaucratic mixup
with Social Security and food stamps suddenly left her
broke and with no income – problems that are on their
way to being fixed, but in the meantime your support
made it possible for SVdP to provide enough rent help to
keep her housed. Thank you! <i>Information</i>,

	<p><b>SUNDAY HOSPITALITY VOLUNTEERS NEEDED</b>. Many
people do not know that there are very few places for
those experiencing food insecurity to get a hot meal on
a Sunday. In order to meet this area of highest need,
St. James is rolling out Early Breakfast, a free Sunday-morning
meal program, starting January 27. The
regular Coffee Hour following the 8am, 10am, and
Noon Masses will remain unchanged; however, we are
in urgent need of volunteers to help at least once a
month with food prep on Saturday afternoons and/or
service and cleanup on Sundays in the early morning.
We are also seeking additional assistance with our
regular Coffee Hour following all Sunday Masses.
These are excellent options for people seeking
volunteer opportunities that fit into their busy work
schedules, or for those looking to complement their
Sunday worship with direct service to those in need.

<p><b>NAMI PEER-TO-PEER SUPPORT GROUP</b> Tuesdays,
January 15 – March 5, 6:00–8:30pm, Pastoral
Outreach Center, Mother Cabrini Room. This is a free
8-session educational program for adults with mental
illness who are looking to better understand their
condition and journey toward recovery. Taught by a
trained team of people who’ve been there, the program
includes presentations, discussion, and interactive
exercises. Everything is confidential and NAMI never
recommends a specific medical therapy or treatment
approach. “It made me feel I was not alone in coping
with mental illness. It gave me hope that I could
recover and that my life would not always be filled
with chaos and it provided positive role models to
inspire me to strive for recuperation and success in
life.” RSVP to
