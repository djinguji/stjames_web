<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>SUPPORT THE WINTER SHELTER</b>. Consider joining the
Winter Shelter team! We have openings for overnight
volunteers for Sunday nights, and breakfast hosts for
Sundays, Mondays and Tuesdays. We also need
volunteers who can substitute in case our regular
volunteers are unavailable. If you cannot be an
overnight host or provide breakfast, you can support
the Winter Shelter by donating: Spray deodorant,
Large tubes of toothpaste, Cough drops, Hand
Warmers, Travel-size Tissues and Lip Balm. Items can
be brought to Coffee Hour, or dropped off or mailed to
the Parish Office. Thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p align="left"><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
young man after weeks of trying unsuccessfully to
contact him as he had no phone and lived in a locked
building on Capitol Hill with no intercom at the front
door. He had been homeless nine months, suffered
from serious depression and had no income other than
food stamps. He seemed so alone and vulnerable. What
he most needed was help with food, clothes and
hygiene items. When we said we could help, he said,
“You have no idea how much this means to me!” The
look of deep gratitude on his face almost made us cry.
Your donations make our help possible – thank you.

<p><b>CARE FOR CREATION TIP</b>. Scoop up any leaves and use
them in your garden to protect plants throughout the
winter — or add them to your compost pile. Fall is the
time to plant spring bulbs and some perennials. And
you can also plant many types of trees and shrubs in
the fall, which will give them enough time to develop a
deep root system over the winter months and reduce
their water needs come spring.</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES CATHEDRAL ON SOCIAL MEDIA</b>. Be sure to
follow the Cathedral on social media for up-to-date
information about ongoing events in the life of the
Cathedral! On Instagram: @stjamescathedral. On
Facebook and Twitter: @stjamesseattle. Did you know the Cathedral has a podcast? 
Father Ryan’s homilies are available on iTunes. Just search “St. James 
Cathedral, Seattle” on Apple podcasts. And of course, you can always visit the 
Cathedral website for up to date information
on Cathedral happenings. If you aren’t getting our
weekly e-newsletters, be sure to check your spam
folder and add St. James to your “safe senders” list!</p>

<p><b>ADVENT GIVING TREE</b>. Consider offering a Christmas
gift to a person in need through the St. James Advent
Giving Tree. This year’s partners include the Skagit
Valley Youth Migrant Project, PREPARES, and
several immigration services in Seattle. This year’s
Advent Giving Tree will be in the Cathedral and at
Coffee Hour beginning Sunday, November 24.</p>
<p><b>PARENTAL NOTIFICATION INITIATIVE</b>. Washington is
one of only six states in the country that do not require
any parental involvement before a minor can have an
abortion. To change this policy, the bishops of
Washington State support an initiative to the
legislature. I-1004 would require physicians to notify a
parent or guardian before performing an abortion on a
minor. The initiative does not require parental
permission, only parental notification. I-1004 contains
reasonable exceptions to protect minors in cases where
notification may threaten the minor’s safety or where a
valid medical exemption is present. Failure to comply
with the law would carry criminal penalties and
provide grounds for civil claims. January 4, 2020 is the
deadline for submission of 320,000 signatures of
registered voters to the office of the Secretary of State.
Petitions will be available to sign through December 1
at the Sunday morning coffee hours and in the west
vestibule of the cathedral after 5:30 Masses. More
information about this initiative can be found at
