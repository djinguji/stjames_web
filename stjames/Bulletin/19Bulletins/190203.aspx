<p><b>NEW! TAI CHI CLASSES</b> at St. James Cathedral,
Fridays from 5–6pm (note time change), beginning

described as "meditation in motion," but it might well
be called "medication in motion." There is growing
evidence that this mind-body practice, which
originated in China as a martial art, has value in
treating or preventing many health problems. And you
can get started even if you aren't in top shape or the
best of health. Classes are for all ages and all levels of
fitness. Seniors are welcome! <i>Information</i>,

“We, young Catholics from World Youth Day in

praise, joy and gratitude for the beautiful gift of our
beloved ‘sister, Mother Earth,’ in the beautiful words
of St. Francis. . . . At the same time, we are painfully
aware, as Pope Francis reminded us, that ‘our common
home is falling into serious disrepair.'” <i>From the 2019
World Youth Day Laudato Si’ manifesto</i>.</p>

<p><b>2019 POINT IN TIME COUNT</b>. During the early morning
hours of Friday, January 25, four representatives from
St. James Cathedral joined hundreds of other King
County residents to take part in the annual count of
those experiencing homelessness. The purpose of the
annual Point in Time (PIT) Count is to collect data on
the needs of people experiencing homelessness in our
community. The count also provides an excellent
opportunity to increase awareness of homelessness and
to spark action. A successful and accurate PIT Count is
an essential component to informing King County’s
response to the need in our community and to
ultimately making homelessness rare, brief and one-time.</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES WINTER SHELTER</b>. Are you looking for a
way to be a part of the solution to our area’s
homelessness crisis? There are currently openings for
volunteers to stay overnight on the 1st or 2nd Sundays
of the month. Overnighters welcome up to 14 men,
aged 50 and older. <i>Information</i>,

legislators and advocate for just policies for the
common good, alongside Catholics from all over the
state. To register, go to <a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.ipjc.org">www.ipjc.org</a>.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we pray for the parishes of St. Mary in Aberdeen,
Seattle, and Seaview, and Star of the Sea Mission in
Stevenson.</p>
