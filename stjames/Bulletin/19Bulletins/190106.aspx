		<font face="Bookman Old Style"><i><font size="4">Dear Friends</font></i></font><font size="4">,</font><p>Now that the flurry of holiday activity is
winding down, I’m coming to you with some
great news and some not-so-great news. The
great news is that some 721 parish households
have made a commitment to support the
Cathedral parish in 2019. The not-so-great
news is that this represents only 28% of our
parish! Ever the optimist, I’m blaming this on
the rush of activities around Christmas and
New Year’s.</p>
<p>Would you consider making a pledge for
2019 if you haven’t already done so? The
pledge cards are back in the pews and chairs
this weekend. Or you can go online to make
your commitment at www.stjames-cathedral.org. Our goal is 1,000 pledges (40%
participation). I think it’s doable, but we do
still have a ways to go!</p>
<p>Thank you very much. May you and your
loved ones know God’s abundant blessings in
this New Year!</p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Shortly before Christmas, we visited a 
young couple with a baby girl. Dad is partially blind and suffers from a 
potentially debilitating disease. Although planning soon to return to work, his 
limited disability income has made it extra hard for this family, and they were 
sleeping on blankets on the floor. With your support, we gave them a bed, helped 
with rent, food and other necessities. Thank you! <i>Information</i>,
