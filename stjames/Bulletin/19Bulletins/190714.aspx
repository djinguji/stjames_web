<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I regret to inform you that the beautiful statue of Mary and the Child Jesus 
that has graced our Mary shrine for the past twenty-two years was badly 
damaged this past week in a fit of rage by a very disturbed person. The statue 
will be able to be restored, but it will take time. Meanwhile, we will 
temporarily replace it with another statue of Our Lady, as soon as we can be 
assured that it will be secure.</p>
<p>The recent acts of vandalism in and around the Cathedral in recent weeks and 
months are a great concern. I’m sure you are all aware of the damage done not 
long ago to the Great Cross (currently undergoing restoration) and to the Seat 
of Wisdom statue in the courtyard (already repaired). Each of these artworks are 
an important part of the holiness of this place, ‘sacraments’ of God’s presence 
among us.</p>
<p>It is no secret that&mdash;despite all the efforts&mdash;our city has shown 
itself incapable of dealing with the severe problems brought about by chronic 
homelessness, mental illness, and drug use. It’s no secret, either, that the 
people who come here are more important than any of the beautiful things we 
cherish, no matter how sacred. But having said that, I ask you to pray that, in 
the days ahead, we will be able to find the balance we need in order to be not 
only a welcoming place but a safe place, and a haven of prayer and peace for all 
who come here.</p>

JAMES</b>. Consider joining Catholics from the West
Seattle parishes on a pilgrimage walk to the Cathedral
celebrating the Feast of St. James the Apostle. The

miles. We will leave from the Guadalupe parking lot on Sunday, July 21 at 6:30 
a.m. and arrive at the cathedral in time for the 10 am Mass. Return to W. 
Seattle by a pre-arranged ride or city bus.

<p><b>CATHEDRAL CHOIR & WOMEN’S SCHOLA AUDITIONS</b>.
Music Director Joseph Adam will be holding auditions
over the summer for membership in the Cathedral
Choir and the Women of St. James Schola. Cathedral
Choir singers must have a good comfort level of
reading music, attend Thursday night rehearsals, and
sing at the Sunday 10:00am Mass and other liturgical
events. The Women of St. James Schola come from
many musical backgrounds and skill levels, and meet
at 4:00pm on Sundays to sing for 5:30pm Mass.
Schola repertoire includes unison chant and 2-3 part
motets. For more information about the required
commitment of these ensembles and to schedule an

<p><b>REPORT FROM ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b>. Your SVdP
donations made it possible for our Cathedral
Vincentians to do 130 home visits during April, May
& June and help 228 low (or no) income residents of
St James parish who struggle to pay for life's
necessities, such as rent, electricity, beds, food, clothes
and basic hygiene products. Your generosity is great,
but we continue to be asked for more help than we can
provide, especially with the high rents in central
Seattle. That means we and those we serve are deeply
grateful for every dollar you share with SVdP – thank you!

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
One of the highest-ranked personal actions that can
reduce our carbon foot print is reducing food waste.
Food waste is a major source of greenhouse gases,
mostly in the form of methane, a pollutant at least 25
times more potent than carbon dioxide. Easy ways to
improve your food lifestyle:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Beef’s carbon footprint is twice that of pork and
four times that of chicken.</li>
	<li>Consider observing “meatless Monday”</li>
	<li>Reduce food waste by planning ahead and storing
food correctly</li>
	<li>Use smaller plates - you will probably eat less and
be healthier too</li>
</ul>
<p><b>JOIN THE ST. JAMES WINTER SHELTER TEAM!</b> From
