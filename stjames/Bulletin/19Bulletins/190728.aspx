<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the

from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral

<p><b>FLORAL OFFERINGS</b> are a wonderful way to remember a
deceased loved one, celebrate an anniversary, or give
thanks for a prayer that has been answered. We currently
have many weekends open, including Sundays, August
18, August 25, September 1, and September 15, 22, and
29. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>IMMIGRATION VIGIL</b>. On Thursday, August 8 at 5:30pm,
St. James Cathedral will host a special Mass in response
to the immigration crisis at our borders. As fear and
xenophobia rise, many of our brothers and sisters live in
fear of ICE raids and family separation. This is an
opportunity to come together in prayerful solidarity for
those who are suffering, and to pray that our nation may
respond with compassion to those who come to our
borders fleeing poverty and violence. The Mass will
conclude with the lighting of candles. Auxiliary Bishop Eusebio Elizondo will preside. All are welcome.</p>
<p><b>FIND OUT MORE ABOUT BECOMING CATHOLIC</b>. Are
you, a family member, or a friend interested in
learning more about the Catholic Church? Come and
See! You’re invited to a no-strings-attached gathering
to ask questions and fine out more on Wednesday,
August 7, at 7:00pm in the Fireside Room (lower level
of the Pastoral Outreach Center at 907 Columbia
Street). Please use the courtyard entrance to access the
Fireside Room. All are welcome, no RSVP needed.</p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL INVITES YOU</b> to explore volunteering with us. Our 
Cathedral Vincentians help parish residents in need of financial aid for rent 
and some of life’s other necessities. We deliver our help through friendly, 
nonjudgmental visits to homes of our neighbors in need. Are you a patient 
listener with compassion for others who are struggling? Then come join us on 
God’s frontline, where we witness His blessings unfold in “ordinary” lives made 
extraordinary by His love. We meet as a group at St. James for about 90 minutes 
on two Tuesday evenings each month. Most of our members also do home visits 
(always in pairs) one or more times per month, each time taking 2-3 hours to 
complete the visits. Please ask us your questions, and we will share more 
details. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>BAPTISM OF INFANTS & YOUNG CHILDREN</b> (under the
age of 7) is celebrated monthly at one of the weekend
Masses. To prepare for this most important sacrament,
parents and godparents participate in a series of classes
to update their understanding of baptism, to reflect on
their responsibility to guide their children in the
practice of the faith, and to learn about the many ways
our parish supports families. Please allow at least two
months for preparation. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>CATHEDRAL CHOIR & WOMEN’S SCHOLA AUDITIONS</b>.
Music Director Joseph Adam will be holding auditions
over the summer for membership in the Cathedral
Choir and the Women of St. James Schola. Cathedral
Choir singers must have a good comfort level of
reading music, attend Thursday night rehearsals, and
sing at the Sunday 10:00am Mass and other liturgical
events. The Women of St. James Schola come from
many musical backgrounds and skill levels, and meet
at 4:00pm on Sundays to sing for 5:30pm Mass.
Schola repertoire includes unison chant and 2-3 part
motets. For more information about the required
commitment of these ensembles and to schedule an
audition, contact

are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we pray for the parishes of St. Alphonsus in Seattle and
St. John Vianney in Kirkland, Vashon, Darrington; and for
the community of St. Ignatius Chapel at Seattle University.</p>
