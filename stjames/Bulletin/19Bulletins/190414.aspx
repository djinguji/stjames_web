<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>EASTER CROWDS</b>. Parishioners, please note that the
Easter morning Masses tend to be very crowded, with
almost as many people standing as sitting at the 10:00am
and 12 Noon Masses. Let’s be as welcoming as possible
to our guests and visitors during the coming holy days! If
you prefer not to brave the crowds (and to keep your
usual seat!), plan on arriving early, or consider attending
the 8:00am or 5:30pm Mass on Easter Day.</p>
<p><b>EASTER GREETERS NEEDED!</b> We need greeters to assist
at the Masses of Easter Day at 10:00am and 12 Noon, to
welcome our visitors and regulars on Easter morning and
hand out programs. You will need to arrive one hour
early. Reserved seats will be provided for you as soon as
Mass begins. <i>Information</i>,

Laughlin</a>.</p>
<p><b>CELEBRATING THE DIVINE MERCY</b>. The Sunday after
Easter (April 28) is Divine Mercy Sunday, celebrating
the mercy and love of Christ. There will be a special
celebration at the Noon Mass that day followed by a
lunch in Cathedral Place Hall. All are welcome! In the
days leading up to Divine Mercy Sunday, beginning on
April 19, a group of parishioners will pray the Divine
Mercy chaplet daily in the Cathedral Chapel at 5:00pm.
All are welcome to join them in this brief devotion,
prayed on rosary beads.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Sometimes we help
people who are on long, difficult personal journeys. A
few months ago a compassionate apartment manager
asked SVdP if we could help a family from Latin America pay rent. Although Mom 
speaks only Spanish, her teenage children are fluent in English. They are all 
trying to build a better future for themselves. But they have no income. Dad 
lives in their native country and is unable to send money. We visited and paid 
just enough rent to avoid eviction. The oldest daughter listened intently as we 
referred the family to other local charities that might give additional help. 
Later, we visited again and, before we left, gave more suggestions to the kind 
manager as to how he might help them obtain even more help elsewhere – help that 
could transform their lives. Without your support, this needy family would 
probably have lost their apartment. Thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>YOUNG ADULT WOMEN’S BIBLE STUDY</b>. We'll be
reading Courageous Women: A Study on the Heroines
of Biblical History by Stacy Mitch. If you need help
purchasing a guide, let us know. We’ll be meeting in
the Fireside Room at the Pastoral Outreach Center at
6:30pm on April 10, 24, May 8, and May 22.

<p><b>PURSE DRIVE THANK YOU</b>. The St. James Young
Adult Women’s Group wants to say thank you to
everyone who donated purses to our drive during the
month of March. We collected nearly 200 purses,
clutches, and wallets for the Jubilee Women's Center.
We appreciate everyone helping to improve the lives
of women in our community.</p>
<p><b>SPRING ECOLOGY FILM SERIES</b>. The St. James Care
for Creation Committee, Seattle First Baptist Church
and Bet Alef Meditative Synagogue will offer a series
of documentaries focused on how we can better care
for our waters, seas and oceans. Films will be on May
6, 13 and 20, 6:30pm at Seattle First Baptist (1111
Harvard Ave.). Sonic Sea, the first offering, is about
protecting life in our waters from the destructive
effects of oceanic noise pollution.</p>
<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
As Easter approaches, reflect on how you can continue
to fast after Lent, by reducing your dependence on SUPs (single-use plastic). Can you recognize how
fasting from SUPs can give you a stronger connection
with your surroundings?</p>
<p><b>CATHOLIC SCHOOLS SCHOLARSHIP DEADLINE
APRIL 30</b>. If you plan to apply for a Scholarship to the
Rainbow Schools or Simperman Scholar Schools,
please note the deadline is quickly approaching. Please
submit all requirements with the application form.

<p><b>SCAM ALERT!</b> Cybercrime is hitting dioceses
nationwide. If you receive a message from Father
Ryan asking for help or requesting you to purchase a
gift card, please delete it. It is a scam! When in doubt,
contact the parish office to verify the legitimacy of any
request you receive from the parish. Thank you!

<p><b>MINISTRY OF PRESENCE IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>.
Each weekday in the Cathedral, a volunteer sits
at a desk in the northeast corner of the Cathedral
near the Mary Shrine, available to answer
questions, accept prayer requests, and greet
visitors who stop in between 1:00pm-4:00pm.
It’s a quiet time to pray, read, and be present to
those who come to the Cathedral, often people in
need. We are currently looking for volunteers
who might cover one afternoon each month,
beginning in May. If you’d some quiet time in
the Cathedral, we’d love to have you be a part of
this ministry. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>MUFFIN BAKERS NEEDED AT COFFEE HOUR</b>. Coffee Hour is looking for muffin 
bakers for 4th Sundays. We are also hiring a Coffee Lead to assist the Coffee 
Hour Manager on the 2nd and 4th Sundays of the month. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>GARDEN SEEKS REGULAR VOLUNTEERS</b>. Are
you interested in seeing what it takes to maintain
a working garden, from seed to harvest? The
Cathedral Kitchen Garden is looking for
volunteers who can come once a week to water,
weed, and reap. This regular help is crucial to
ensuring we are able to maintain a consistent
output of fresh, organic produce for our
homeless and food-insecure guests at the
Cathedral Kitchen. Come and help us grow!

<p><b>VAN DRIVERS NEEDED</b>. Our Sunday van ministry
is an important outreach to senior parishioners
who would not be able to get to 10:00am Mass
on Sunday if it weren’t for our drivers. It’s a
simple but important way to reach out to some of
our senior parishioners! <b>Right now we have a
need for just a driver on the third or fifth
Sunday of the month</b>. All training provided;
background check required. <i>Information</i>,
