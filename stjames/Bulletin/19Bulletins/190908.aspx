<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Archbishops have been much in the news these days! Last Sunday at noon Mass 
we had a wonderful opportunity to bid farewell to Archbishop Sartain and to 
thank him for his years of loving ministry among us. Then, on Tuesday, we got 
word that Pope Francis had accepted Archbishop Sartain’s resignation and 
Archbishop Paul Etienne officially took the reins as our new archbishop.</p>
<p>Because we already celebrated Archbishop Etienne’s appointment as coadjutor 
at a Mass of Welcome when he first arrived here in June, there was no formal 
‘passing of the torch’ on the day he took over as archbishop – only a simple 
celebration of the 5:30 evening Mass at which he presided and preached.</p>
<p>That same day, Archbishop Etienne released a letter to the people of the 
archdiocese which was immediately made available on the Northwest Catholic 
website (<a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.nwcatholic.org">www.nwcatholic.org</a>). I 
encourage you to read it because he sets forth in the letter a broad vision of 
the direction in which he intends to lead us Among other things, he makes clear 
that enabling all the people to come to know Christ and to live and preach his 
gospel in a compelling way is at the top of his agenda. He also intends to 
consult widely among the members of the Church, the priestly people of God, as 
he leads us.</p>
<p>In the days ahead, we will have the opportunity to come to know our new 
archbishop, Based upon the time I’ve been privileged to spend with him, I am 
confident that he is a leader who is committed to the great vision of Pope 
Francis and that you will like what you see!</p>
<p>I know Archbishop Etienne will count on the prayers of all of us in the 
coming days and years and I’m confident that we will be very much in his.</p>
<p>Welcome, Archbishop Etienne!</p>

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
From Pope Francis’ 2019 message for the World Day
of Prayer for the Care of Creation: “Each Christian
man and woman, every member of the human family,
can act as a thin yet unique and indispensable thread in
weaving a network of life that embraces everyone.
May we feel challenged to assume, with prayer and
commitment, our responsibility for the care of
creation.”</p>
