<p><b>EVERY YEAR IN WASHINGTON STATE, MORE THAN 12
MILLION POUNDS OF LITTER</b> are tossed and blown onto
our highways and roads. Cleaning up our streets is a
vital way to keep trash from washing into our
waterways. These efforts not only beautify our city but
protect whales, sea otters, and even small crustaceans
and phytoplankton that are vital food sources for these
larger sea creatures. Will you do your part to help
out? Join the Care for Creation Committee on
Sunday, June 2 to help beautify the First Hill
neighborhood by picking up street litter immediately
around St. James Cathedral. We will meet promptly
after the 10:00am Mass at the northeast entrance of the
Cathedral (Terry and Marion). Supplies will be
provided, including garbage bags, gloves, and tongs/litter pickers. We will have a brief orientation at 11:15
to explain the routes, safety, and cleanup. Please plan
for about two hours. Long pants are recommended, but
not required. And please, bring a friend, or two or three.
After all, the more, the merrier!</p>
<p><b>LAST YOUTH NIGHT BEFORE SUMMER BREAK</b>. Come
send off our graduating seniors and celebrate with an
ice cream party! Welcome to all those aged 13-18.
We’ll be in Pastoral Outreach Center courtyard from
6:30-8:30pm on Sunday, June 2.</p>
<p><b>FIND OUT MORE ABOUT BECOMING CATHOLIC</b>.
Are you, a family member, or a friend interested in
learning more about the Catholic Church? Come and
See! You’re invited to a no-strings-attached gathering to
ask questions and find out more on Wednesday, June 5
at 7:00pm in the Fireside Room (lower level of the
Pastoral Outreach Center at 907 Columbia Street). All
are welcome; no RSVP needed.</p>
<p><b>BECOME AN IMMIGRATION CHAMPION</b>. Join us to
pray, learn, and take action to make a difference
locally, nationally, and around the world. Gain a

response to the global refugee and migration crisis at
home and around the world. Wednesday, June 5,

<p><b>SUNDAY BREAKFAST VOLUNTEERS NEEDED</b>. Now
that the weather is warming up, more homeless people
are opting to spend the night outside, instead of in
shelters. With the change in season has come an
increased demand for morning meals. Early Breakfast
needs a few extra hands to help feed everyone who
comes to our doors on Sunday! Start your week off
right by feeding those in need. <i>Information</i>,
