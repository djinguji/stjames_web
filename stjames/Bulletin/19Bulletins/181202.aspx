<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN BECOMING CATHOLIC?</b> If you are an adult who has 
never been baptized, an adult who has been baptized in another Christian 
tradition or a Catholic who has been baptized, but not received First Eucharist 
or Confirmation, you are invited to participate in the RCIA, a process of 
initiation into the Catholic Church. You can learn more by going to the
<a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/rcia/default.aspx">RCIA website</a>. <i>

<p><b>THE ANNUAL ST. JAMES GIVING TREE</b> is up in the
Cathedral and at Coffee Hour. Please consider taking a
tag and provide a gift for someone who is assisted by
the Cathedral or one of our local partners. This year,
gifts will support the Frederick Ozanam House, the
King County Juvenile Detention Center, the Skagit
Valley Youth Migrant Project, and PREPARES.
Thanks for your generosity!</p>
<p align="left"><b>EMAIL SCAM</b>. In the past few months, there have been
reports of parishioners and parish staff receiving
emails claiming to be from their parish priest, and
requesting that the recipient send gift cards or initiate
wire transfers. Someone is setting up fake email
addresses using the pastor’s name. This is happening
across the Archdiocese of Seattle. Please be aware that
this is a scam. <i>Information</i>,
