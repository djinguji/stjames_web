<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered by Bridget
Cooley on the 11th anniversary of the death of her
father, Charley McIntyre.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO</b>. This month, all espresso sales
benefit St. James Winter Shelter. The Espresso Cart is
open at coffee hour after the 10:00am Mass.</p>
<p><b>SPECIAL SEATING FOR CHILDREN WHO WANT TO
WITNESS TODAY’S INFANT BAPTISMS AT THE NOON
MASS</b>. After the homily, listen for Father Ryan’s
invitation to come sit near the baptistry. Children will
return to their families directly after the Baptisms.</p>
<p><b>ASSISTED LISTENING DEVICES</b>. If you have trouble
hearing the spoken word during Mass, the Cathedral
offers assisted listening devices which provide crystal
clear sound. Listening devices are always available to
borrow—just ask an usher. In addition, if you are a
regular who would like to purchase your own listening
device to use whenever you come to Mass, please
contact
<a href="mailto:claughlin@stjames-cathedral.orgq?subject=Assisted listening devices">Corinna Laughlin</a> at 206-264-2086.</p>
<p><b>ALL SAINTS</b>. The Solemnity of All Saints is November
1. Masses for the Holy Day will be on Thursday,
October 31 at 5:30pm, and Friday, November 1 at
8:15am, 10:45am (with O’Dea High School), and
5:30pm. <i>Please note that because of the Solemnity,
there will be no First Friday Exposition and Holy Hour
this month. Because of the Solemn Requiem, there will
be no Ecumenical Prayer with music from Taizé in
November</i>.</p>
<p><b>ROSARY</b>. All are welcome to join with a group of
parishioners who pray the rosary together in the Chapel,
Monday through Saturday at 7:40am.</p>
<p><b>ALL SOULS</b>. The Commemoration of the Faithful
Departed is November 2. The solemn Requiem Mass
of All Souls will be Friday, November 1 at 7:30pm. On
November 2, there will be one Mass in the morning at
8:15am. <i>Please note that the 5:30pm Mass on
Saturday, November 2 will be the anticipated Mass of
the Thirty-First Sunday in Ordinary Time</i>.</p>
<p><b>MASS FOR THE DECEASED HOMELESS</b> Thursday,
November 7 at 5:30pm. Please join the St. James
Housing Advocacy Committee to pray for women and
men who have died this past year on the streets or by
violence in our community. All are welcome to honor
their memory and to celebrate their lives. Donations of
hats, gloves and scarves are gladly accepted. After
Mass, there will be a reading of the names of those
who have died, followed by a simple reception.</p>
<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Vacuum the refrigerator coils to keep the compressor
running efficiently. It's also a good time to check that
the refrigerator is level; the door should automatically
swing shut instead of staying open. Check the seal on
the door by closing it on a dollar bill. If you can pull
the bill out easily, it's time to replace the gaskets.
Another tip for running the refrigerator efficiently is to
not overfill it - allowing room for cool air to circulate
will keep everything at the right temperature.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. An elderly man
called the SVdP Helpline (206-767-6449) and asked for help with a long list of 
things. When we visited, he talked almost nonstop for an hour (most of our 
visits are no more than 20 minutes). We heard wonderful stories about and saw 
photos of his mom, uncles, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We 
learned about his many medical challenges, his military service in Vietnam and 
more. In the end, all he asked us for was a small amount of financial help so he 
could buy some cleaning supplies and a bit of food. We realized that what he 
most wanted was someone to talk with, and we were happy to listen. Your support 
makes visits like this possible – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>NIGHTWATCHERS NEEDED</b>. On Second Sundays of
every month, a team of St. James volunteers serve the
evening meal at Operation Nightwatch. This dinner is
one of the latest of the day, meaning that it is often the
only place where food-insecure people who work into
the evening can get a hot meal. Right now, our team is
desperately understaffed, and we are in urgent need of
servers. If you have one free evening a month, please
consider volunteering for this important ministry.

<p><b>MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS MINISTRY</b>.
Cathedral parishioner Terry Proctor has been a great
asset to the Mental Health & Wellness Ministry for
five years. He leads a support group for family
members of adult children who live with severe and
persistent mental illness. Terry is a empathic group
facilitator with personal experience of having a family
member who lives with mental illness. The group
meets once a month at St. James. <i>Information</i>, Terry

<img border="0" src="../../images/RespectLifeMonth.png" width="419" height="237" align="left"><b>REFLECTION FOR RESPECT LIFE MONTH</b>.</p>

<p>The U.S.
bishops write that, “The Church teaches us that
‘the one who has hope lives differently’ (<i>Spe
salvi</i> 2). Christ’s promise of salvation does not
mean that we will be spared from suffering.
Rather, the promise of salvation ensures that even
in the darkest moments of our lives, we will be
given the strength to persevere. By virtue of this
Christian hope, we can face any challenge or trial.
When the seas of life swell and we are battered by
the waves, hope allows us to remain anchored in
the heart of God. May we hold fast to Christ our
hope, from the beginning of life to its very end.”</p>

our parish supports families. Please allow at least two
months for preparation. <i>Information</i>,
