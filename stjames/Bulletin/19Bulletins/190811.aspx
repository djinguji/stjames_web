<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how

Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a middle-aged woman who had 
her “dream job” at an upscale local restaurant. The manager gave her good 
performance evaluations and she was happy. Then the manager was replaced with a 
new manager who taunted her in a racist manner and soon she was forced to leave 
her dream job behind. She quickly found a new job but was without income while 
waiting to start work. With your financial support, we paid enough rent to keep 
her housed during this difficult time – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>TAI CHI CLASSES HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED</b> for the
remainder of the summer and will resume again in the
fall. On behalf of all the Tai Chi students who attended
weekly classes for the past six months, we wish to
express gratitude to our instructor, Mark Krimmel, PT,
DPT for this opportunity.</p>
<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Of the estimated 29 billion gallons of water used daily
by households in the US, nearly 9 billion gallons
(30%) is used outdoors. In the hot summer months,
that percentage often goes up to 70%. You can help
change that by replacing part of your lawn with native
and drought resistant plants.</p>

together. St. James Cathedral offers emergency
