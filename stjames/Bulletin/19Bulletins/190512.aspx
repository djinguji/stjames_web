<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
middle-aged man who earned enough money to live on
until the moment he was struck by an uninsured “hit &
run” driver as he walked across the street. Serious
injuries kept him in the hospital for months and then in
a wheelchair for a year, needing constant care. When
we visited, he no longer needed a wheelchair but was
still weak, sore and sleeping on an old, borrowed
mattress on the floor. Also on the floor, near the head
of his bed, was a chemical powder running along the
baseboard trim. The powder was from a recent
(successful) attempt to rid the apartment of roaches.
Despite his circumstances, the man displayed a
positive attitude, smiling when he said, “Things could
be worse!” We gave him a proper new bed, up off the
floor, and he now sleeps better and with less pain.
Your support made this possible – thank you!
