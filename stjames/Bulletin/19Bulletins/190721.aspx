the Pacific Northwest. We will have a guided walk

grey and Mexican wolves, as well as an educational
course on wolves in North America, including pack
habits, present dangers, how wolves communicate, and
more! Reserve a space by July 23, and indicate if you

<p><b>BAPTISM OF INFANTS & YOUNG CHILDREN</b> (under the
age of 7) is celebrated monthly at one of the weekend
Masses. To prepare for this most important sacrament,
parents and godparents participate in a series of classes

their responsibility to guide their children in the
practice of the faith, and to learn about the many ways
our parish supports families. Please allow at least two
months for preparation. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a young, single mom with 
four small children. She had started a new daycare job three months before our 
visit but had yet to receive her first paycheck. She was trying to keep up with 
basic living expenses for her family by cleaning houses in her “spare” time. 
With your financial support, we helped her pay for food, clothes and hygiene 
items, which eased this very stressful situation until she started receiving 
regular paychecks – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS MINISTRY</b>. As we
reflect on incidents of the defacing of cherished
symbols of our faith in recent months, let us keep
individuals living with severe and chronic mental
illness and those experiencing alcoholism and
addictions in our prayers. Some patron saints who
have also struggled and who have advocated for those
afflicted are:</p>
<ul>

mental disorders – (feast day March 8)</li>
<li>Benedict Joseph Labre – Patron of anxiety and
homelessness (April 16)</li>

victims of incest (May 15)</li>

those in recovery (June 19)</li>

mental health caregivers (July 24)</li>
