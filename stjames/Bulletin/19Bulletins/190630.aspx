<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>It’s now been eight weeks since we launched this year’s Annual Catholic 
Appeal. To date some 549 of our parishioners have made a give, which is great. 
What is not so great is that we are a parish of 2,612 households, which means 
there are still some 2,063 parish households who have not yet made their 
commitment. Hard to believe, but it’s true! And we are <i>way behind</i> where 
we were at this point last year. To be perfectly frank, this is quite 
concerning!</p>
<p>While we have now met the $373,578 goal set for us by the Archbishop, we are 
over $125,000 shy of what we need to raise in order to fund a fire sprinkler 
system in the Cathedral attic. After the catastrophic fire this past April at 
Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, I’m use you agree with me that it would be 
irresponsible for us not to take this precaution. The estimated cost for the 
sprinkler system is $350,000.</p>
<p>So, if you are are among the number who have not yet given to the Appeal, I 
would ask you please to consider doing so now. Think of it this way: if each of 
those 2,063 households that we haven’t heard from yet were to give just $75, 
we’d for surpass our goal! You can make a gift using the special envelopes in 
the pews and chairs, or online at
<a href="https://donate.seattlearchdiocese.org/aca">
https://donate.seattlearchdiocese.org/aca</a>. </p>
<p>I wouldn’t be making this request if I didn’t know how much you love our 
Cathedral. A gift to the Appeal is the perfect way to show this love!</p>

<p><b>LAUDATO SI’ REGIONAL GATHERING</b> Tuesday, July 9,
11am-2pm. Holy Names Room, Pastoral Outreach
Center. Through his encyclical <i>Laudato Si’, On Care for
Our Common Home</i>, Pope Francis calls for “a
conversation which includes everyone, since the
environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its
human roots, concern and affect us all.” Catholic
parishes and institutions are invited to learn from one
another, and to strategize ways that we can take action
on behalf of our Sister, Mother Earth. The day will
include opportunities for prayer through an ecological
spirituality, for local Catholics to share updates on local
and national endeavors, for parishes and institutions to
look ahead to the future, and for the emergence of new
partnerships and networking, all on behalf of our
common home. At the end of the day, each attendee
should be educated, inspired and motivated with a
deeper reverence and respect for God’s Creation.

that the weather is warming up, more homeless people

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a middle-aged man who 
supplements his modest Social Security Disability Income with part-time wages. 
For years he worked hard with doctors to stabilize his ongoing health problems 
enough so he could start working more hours. But he did not realize that his 
monthly premiums for health insurance would increase as his wages went up. 
Suddenly he was confronted with a past-due bill for three months of higher 
premiums. Unable to pay both his rent and the higher premiums, he asked for our 
help, and we gave him enough rent to get caught up. Thanks to your donations, he 
should be able to keep up with his expenses going forward!
