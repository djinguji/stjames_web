<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>COMMUNAL RECONCILIATION SERVICES</b> will be held
on Saturday, December 15 at 4:00pm and Monday,
December 17 at 7:30pm. During these beautiful services
of readings, reflection and song, we will open ourselves
to experience the gift of God’s gracious and loving
forgiveness in the Sacrament of Penance. It has long
been a tradition in the church to confess one’s sins
before celebrating the great feast of Christmas. These
will be ideal times to do so.</p>
<p><b>SENIOR CHRISTMAS SOCIAL</b>. Mark your calendar for
the Senior Christmas Social on Thursday, December
20, 1:00–3:00 pm, Pastoral Outreach Center. Ms. Selina Chu, St. James parishioner and accomplished
pianist, is back by popular demand and will spread her
unique Christmas warmth and cheer with joyful
Christmas Carols to be sung by all. Don’t miss this
opportunity to eat, drink and be merry!</p>

	<p><b>SIMBANG GABI CELEBRATION</b> Saturday, December
15, 11:00am Mass. Join Archbishop Sartain and
participants from some 80 parishes for the festive
opening celebration of Simbang Gabi, a novena of
Masses in which we prepare for Christmas in company
with Mary. This colorful and prayerful Mass includes
the blessing of parols (traditional star shaped lanterns
from the Philippines) and helps us to focus our
Christmas celebration on the coming of Jesus, Light of
the World. All are welcome.</p>
<p><b>MEDIEVAL WOMEN’S CHOIR: HODIE!</b> Saturday,
December 15 at 8:00pm. The explosive joy of
Christmas is summed up in this one exclamation.
“Hodie”—or “Today”—is the word that begins many
of the sacred texts sung on Christmas in the Middle
Ages: Today Christ is born! Today the Savior appears!
Today on earth the angels sing! The Medieval
Women’s Choir unleashes its joy in sharing
masterpieces of the season from cathedral, court, and
countryside. <i>Information and passes</i>,

<p><b>GREENING OF THE CATHEDRAL</b>. On Friday, December
21 at 6:15pm, Cathedral Young Adults are invited to
help decorate the Cathedral for Christmas. This is a
fun evening for anyone in their 20’s or 30’s to come
together to make the Cathedral even more beautiful for
the Christmas season. We’ll start with pizza and cider
and then head over to the Cathedral. This is a favorite
event for young adults—we hope you can join us!
RSVP required. <i>Information or to RSVP</i>,

<p><b>ADVENT GIVING TREE</b>. This weekend is your last
opportunity to take a tag from the St. James Giving
Trees, located in the Cathedral and at Coffee Hour.
This year, gifts will support Ozanam House, King
County Juvenile Detention Center, Skagit Valley
Youth Migrant Project, and PREPARES. All gifts
must be turned in next Sunday, December 16, so that
they can be distributed in time for Christmas. Thank
you for your generosity.</p>
<p align="left"><b>EMAIL SCAM</b>. In the past few months, there have been
reports of parishioners and parish staff receiving
emails claiming to be from their parish priest, and
requesting that the recipient send gift cards or initiate
wire transfers. Someone is setting up fake email
addresses using the pastor’s name. This is happening
across the Archdiocese of Seattle. Please be aware that
this is a scam. <i>Information</i>,

<p align="center"><b>ADVENT PRAYERS<br>
FOR REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS</b></p>
<p align="center"><i>Second Week of Advent</i></p>
<p>Merciful God, human history has always been a
history of life on the move. We are a people on a
journey. We are grateful for the earth that sustains
us, but we do not always take time to thank you.
Too often lack compassion for our brothers and
sisters who have been uprooted by violence, natural
disasters and poverty.</p>
<p>God, no one is stranger to you. And no one is ever
far from your loving care. In your kindness watch
over migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, those
separated from their loved ones. Bring them safely
to the place where they long to be, and help us
always to show your kindness to strangers and those
in need. We ask this through Christ our Lord,
who became a refugee and migrant. Amen.</p>
