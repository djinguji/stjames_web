<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>We began the month of November with beautiful celebrations of the liturgy on both
All Saints and All Souls Days. Particularly memorable was the Mass a week ago Friday,
the Vigil of All Souls, when the Cathedral Choir and Orchestra performed the Mozart
<i>Requiem</i>. The Cathedral was full of people from near and far. The Mass was riveting in its
prayerfulness and the music was, of course, magnificent. It was a fitting way to
remember and to commend to a merciful and loving God all the people—many of them
family members and friends—who have died, some of them recently, others long years
ago. Happily, the Church each year gives us the whole month of November to remember
the souls of the faithful departed in our prayers. It’s both our duty and our privilege to
do this and it should draw all of us more closely together in the great Communion of
Saints.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Communion of Saints: you are no doubt aware that every
November, on the front of the weekly bulletin, we print the names of a growing list of
people I have come to think of as among the “saints” of St. James Cathedral. They are
generous people who, over the years, have made a bequest to the Cathedral in their will.
I hope you will look over that list of names. Some of them you may recognize but
whether you do or not, please do take a moment to offer a prayer for them and to give
thanks to God for their generosity. The largest of the bequests represented among those
names were as much as one million dollars; the smallest were in the hundreds. In each
case, whether large or small, their generosity has helped us to carry on our mission as a
parish. We would never be able to do what we do were it not for their help. May God
grant each one of them eternal light, rest, and peace!</p>
<p>At the end of the 10:00 Mass today we will take a moment to thank Sister Anne
Herkenrath for her decades of service to our parish. In the near future, she will be
moving to Marylhurst, Oregon (near Portland), where she will join other Sisters of the
Holy Names of Jesus and Mary in a retirement community. It will be coming full circle
for her because that’s exactly where she began her religious life as a postulant and novice
some seventy years ago!</p>
<p>Bidding farewell to Sister Anne is a painful thing for me and for everyone who
knows and loves her. In so many ways, she has been right at the heart of this parish for
all the many years she has served here. When I arrived here as pastor in 1988, Sister Anne
is the one I depended upon more than anyone else to show me “the ropes,” and to help
me find my way. I could never have done it without her. Over the years, we became dear
friends as she guided me with her down-to-earth wisdom, put up with my
idiosyncrasies, inspired me by her love for Jesus and for the Church, and got me to slow
down and smile when the challenges were great. So many of us have our Sr. Anne stories
and we will tell them as long as we live!</p>
<p>I hope you will find an opportunity today or in the near future to express your
gratitude to her and to wish her well on this newest stage of her pilgrimage of life and
faith. And please join me in praying for her – that her transition to Marylhurst will be a
smooth one, that she will know deep peace, and that she will continue to enjoy the love
and company of family and friends who love her beyond measure!</p>

<p><b>CARE FOR CREATION TIP</b>. Cooler temperatures can
lower tire pressure and under-inflated tires reduce your
car’s fuel efficiency. Check that your tires are inflated
to the proper pressure. And while you’re at it, check
your car service records; is it time to rotate your tires
yet? By regularly rotating your tires, you make sure
your tires wear evenly. Regular rotation can extend
your tire life and improve your gas mileage.</p>
