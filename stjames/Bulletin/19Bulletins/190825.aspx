<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the

Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person

more about the Catholic Church? Come and See! You’re

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Pope Francis established September 1 as the <i>World Day
of Prayer for the Care of Creation</i>, encouraging the
Catholic community around the world to pray for our
common home. The day is inspired by Pope Francis'
landmark encyclical <i>Laudato Si’</i>, which calls on "every
person living on this planet" to care for our shared Earth.
He calls us all to celebrate this opportune moment to
“reaffirm [our] personal vocation to be stewards of
creation.” Pray for the earth, our common home,
particularly on the World Day of Prayer for the Care of
Creation (1 September) and throughout the Season of
Creation (September 1 through October 4, the feast of St.
Francis).</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a middle -aged blind man who 
has difficulty walking and standing for long periods because his foot was 
crushed in an accident. His only income is from occasional day labor jobs, but 
most such jobs are not compatible with his disabilities. Luckily, he has a 
rent-subsidized apartment, and his rent is only $208 monthly. He asked us for 
rent help, and your support allowed us to help him avoid eviction – thank you!
