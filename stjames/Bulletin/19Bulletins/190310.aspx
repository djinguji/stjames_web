May our Lent this year be a journey... bringing the hope
of Christ also to creation, so that it may be “set free

at 7:30pm, Samuel Libra, Associate Cathedral
Organist of St. James Cathedral and doctoral student at
the UW School of Music, presents a free recital of
music inspired by J. S. Bach. Eminent French
composer and teacher Charles-Marie Widor once
called Bach “the father of us all,” and his music
inspired organists to emulate and parody him for
generations. Various devotees from Bach’s own
student, J. L. Krebs, to trail-blazing Franz Liszt are
represented alongside music of Vivaldi, so admired by
Bach that he transcribed it for organ. No passes
required for this concert.</p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a woman in her early 60s who 
walks with a cane and needs hip replacement surgery but cleans houses to 
supplement her $700 monthly disability income. She also helps care for her mom, 
who is nearly 100 years old. Recently she lost at least two of her best clients. 
At almost the same time, her rent went up $100 a month, an increase of more than 
10%. We helped pay the rent to keep her housed as she looks for a more 
affordable apartment. Your support makes our financial help possible – thank 
you! <i>Information</i>,
