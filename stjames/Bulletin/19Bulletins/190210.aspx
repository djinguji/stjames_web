<p>Dear Friends,</p>
	<p>You will no doubt notice that the crucifix hanging near the altar of the
Cathedral is not the one you are used to. It saddens me to have to tell you
that that crucifix was severely damaged some days ago when a deranged
person managed to get behind it and send it crashing to the floor. We have
been told by a skilled art conservator that she will be able to restore it but
that it will most likely take many months to do so. I find this reassuring
because the crucifix is beloved of many and has been in the Cathedral for 70
years. Since the renovation of 1994 it has not only stood near the altar but
has led many a procession into the Cathedral on great feasts and
solemnities.
</p>
<p>The beautiful icon cross that now hangs in its place is the work of our
Cathedral iconographer, Joan Brand-Landkamer, whose icons regularly
grace our liturgical celebrations. Over the years, Joan has written upwards
of 40 icons for the Cathedral.
</p>
<p>A mindless act of destruction is heart-breaking and difficult to
understand. I am hoping in this case that it will prompt you to pray for the
person responsible and to pray for all people who live with the awful
scourge of mental illness.</p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. After living on the streets over two 
years while battling addiction issues, a middle-aged man – now proudly sober – 
moved into a subsidized apartment and asked for our help. His Social Security 
Disability Income pays his rent and gives him enough cash each month to buy food 
and other necessities. But he could not afford a bed. With your financial 
support, we gave him a new bed to get him off the floor, better rested and 
better able to cope with sleep apnea. A bright man, he now plans to take college 
courses to become a paraprofessional. Your help changes lives. Thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>NEW! TAI CHI CLASSES</b> at St. James Cathedral, Fridays
from 5–6pm (note time change), Pastoral Outreach
Center. Tai chi is often described as “meditation in
motion,” but it might well be called “medication in
motion.” There is growing evidence that this mind-body
practice, which originated in China as a martial art, has
value in treating or preventing many health problems.
And you can get started even if you aren't in top shape or
the best of health. Classes are for all ages and all levels
of fitness. Seniors are welcome! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.

difference for our planet. Walk, use a bicycle, or take
public transportation. <i>This tip comes from World Youth
Day 2019</i>.</p>
