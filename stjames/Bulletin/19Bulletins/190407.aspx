<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p>
<b>ST. JAMES ECOLOGY FAIR</b> Sunday, April 7 after the
10am and 12 Noon Masses in Cathedral Hall. Pope
Francis’ encyclical <i>Laudato Si</i>’ calls for every person on
the planet to show mercy to the Earth, our common
home. Our annual fair is an opportunity to become better
informed and to take action to protect and nurture our
environment.</p>
<p><b>FAMILY STATIONS OF THE CROSS</b> immediately
following the Noon Mass today. Please join us in this 15-minute traditional prayer, led by the young people of the
parish.</p>
<p><b>CHRISM MASS</b>. On Thursday, April 11, at 7:00pm, you
are invited to join Archbishop Sartain and the priests
of the Archdiocese of Seattle for the annual Chrism
Mass, during which oils are blessed for use in the
celebration of the sacraments at the Easter Vigil and
throughout the coming year. All are welcome. Because
of the Chrism Mass, there will be no 5:30pm Mass on
April 11.</p>
<p><b>EASTER CROWDS</b>. Parishioners, please note that the
Easter morning Masses tend to be very crowded, with
almost as many people standing as sitting at the 10:00am
and 12 Noon Masses. Let’s be as welcoming as possible
to our guests and visitors during the coming holy days! If
you prefer not to brave the crowds (and to keep your
usual seat!), plan on arriving early, or consider attending
the 8:00am or 5:30pm Mass on Easter Day.</p>
<p><b>EASTER GREETERS NEEDED!</b> We need greeters to assist
at the Masses of Easter Day at 10:00am and 12 Noon, to
welcome our visitors and regulars on Easter morning and
hand out programs. You will need to arrive one hour
early. Reserved seats will be provided for you as soon as
Mass begins. <i>Information</i>,

Laughlin</a>.</p>
<p><b>ROSARY</b>. All are welcome to join with a group of
parishioners who pray the rosary together in the Chapel,
Monday through Saturday at 7:40am.</p>
<p><b>CATHOLIC SCHOOLS SCHOLARSHIP DEADLINE
APRIL 30</b>. If you plan to apply for a Scholarship to the
Rainbow Schools or Simperman Scholar Schools,
please note the deadline is quickly approaching. Please
submit all requirements with the application form.

<p><b>YOUNG ADULT WOMEN’S PURSE DRIVE</b>. Our young
adult women’s group is hosting a purse drive for the
Jubilee Women’s Center. This organization helps
women experiencing poverty with education, job
skills, housing, and clothing. Purses are the least
donated yet most highly sought item in their boutique.
Please drop off a new or gently used purse at Coffee
Hour on Sundays or the parish office during the week.

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL ASKS YOU</b> to please take time
during Lent to select and set aside a few “treasures”
you can part with at our annual “Stuff the Truck”
event. This year’s “Stuff” will be on Sunday, May 26
in the O’Dea parking lot, from 8am to 2pm. That is a
later date than in recent years, giving you more time to
select gently used (or new) items to donate. Big sellers
in our thrift stores include books, DVDs, dishes, pots,
pans, other kitchen items and clothes. The money
raised from selling your items in SVdP stores supports
SVdP activities that help low income residents
throughout King County. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Plastic remains in our ecosystem for hundreds of
years. It kills countless fish and hundreds of thousands
of marine mammals every year. To prevent plastic
waste ending up in the oceans, consider a “litter
pilgrimage” this Lent. On your next prayer walk, bring
a bag to collect any garbage you encounter. Invite
friends, other parishioners, or neighbors to come
along, and make it a group effort to clean up plastic
waste!</p>
<p><b>THE ARCHDIOCESE OF SEATTLE</b> urges anyone who
suspects abuse by any Church personnel to contact
local law enforcement. In addition, anyone who has
knowledge of sexual abuse or misconduct by a
member of the clergy, an employee or volunteer of the
Archdiocese of Seattle is urged to call the
archdiocesan hotline at 1-800-446-7762.</p>

<p><b>CRS RICE BOWL FOR THE FIFTH WEEK OF LENT</b>. This
week, we encounter Ona in Gaza, where despite lack
of economic opportunity, people pursue their dreams
by building businesses to better their lives. How do
your daily choices impact others throughout the
world? How can your choices support the dignity of
workers? Visit <a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.crsricebowl.org">www.crsricebowl.org</a> for more. St.
James Cathedral will be collecting your Rice Bowls at
the Holy Thursday Mass. If you cannot turn yours in
that night, then please place it in the collection basket
at Mass on Easter Sunday. Thank you for your Lenten
sacrifice that brings hope to our sisters and brothers
most in need.</p>

Masses. To prepare for this most important sacrament,

their responsibility to guide their children in the
practice of the faith, and to learn about the many ways
our parish supports families. Please allow at least two
months for preparation. <i>Information</i>,
