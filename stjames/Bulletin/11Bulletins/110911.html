<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b> are from the Pettigrew
family in loving memory of David Pettigrew. Flowers
are also from Jess and Elizabeth Hernandez in memory
of Father Mychal Judge and the New York firefighters
who perished on 9/11. <i>Floral offerings are a wonderful
way to remember a deceased loved one, celebrate an
anniversary, or give thanks for a prayer that has been
answered. If you have been inspired to give thanks with
flowers, please contact

<p><b>MUSIC FOR 9/11</b>. Today at the 10:00am Mass
the Cathedral Choir and congregation sing Herbolsheimer’s moving <i>St. James Mass for Peace</i>.
This musical prayer, commissioned in 1982 for
Archbishop Hunthausen, features hauntingly beautiful
meditations for oboe solo as well as very familiar
hymns and responses for the congregation. </p>
<p><b>TOURS OF THE CATHEDRAL</b>. We’ve had such an
extraordinary response to the Wednesday tours of the
Cathedral we’ve offered all summer, that we will continue
to offer tours of the Cathedral each Wednesday at 1:00pm
throughout the year. This is a great way to share the
Cathedral with family and guests.</p>
<p><b>CHILDREN’S FAITH FORMATION</b>. Registration will be

Your prayers strengthened us and helped us have a
great week as well. If you are a youth and would like to
participate in the 2012 mission trip or a parishioner

Youth Migrant Project 2012, please contact Christine

James thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During August, we made 51
home visits to our low income neighbors. Your

families with their rent, keeping them safely in their
homes. We also prevented 4 utility shut offs.
Additionally, we provided food for 17 families and
supplied 14 St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Store vouchers
for beds, furniture, housewares and clothes. As calls
for help continue to increase, we actively seek new
members. Please consider joining our ministry to the
poor among us. <i>Information</i>, Rob Millar 206-954-8902
