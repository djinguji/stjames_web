<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>When I came to you back in November to speak about Sacrificial
Giving, I told you that I came with confidence, a confidence borne of my
long experience of your generosity. My confidence was well-placed.
Your response to my request to increase your level of giving in order to
offset a serious budget deficit was nothing short of phenomenal. As of
this writing, 466 of you have made a commitment to increase your
giving this year, while 129 of you have made a pledge for the first 
time — with the result that our projected $375,000 deficit has been all but
erased!</p>
<p>I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your incredibly
generous response. I include in my thanks each one of you who has
filled out a commitment card — not just those of you who were able to
increase your giving. And I thank those, too, who indicated that they
will support the work of the parish by their prayers.</p>
<p>As we approach the great feast of Christmas and are reminded of the
incomparably great gift God has given to us in Jesus Christ, I want to
tell you how deeply grateful I am for the gifts you share so generously
with this wonderful parish.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>CHORAL MUSIC AT 10:00</b>. This year during the Sundays
of Advent, the Cathedral Choir and Soloists will be
singing the Advent portion of Handel’s <i>Messiah</i>.</p>
<p><b>NEW IN THE BOOKSTORE</b>. Beautiful bracelets with
antique holy medals, handmade by a parishioner; all
proceeds benefit St. James. The perfect gift! Also:
reading for Advent and Christmas, books, gifts, and more!</p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b> is up and running!
Your friendly Cathedral baristas will be serving espresso
drinks after the 10:00 Mass. <i>During the month of
December, all proceeds will benefit the 7th annual Advent
sock drive for homeless men</i>. If you are interested in
becoming a Cathedral barista, please call Sean and
Katherine Berry at 206-571-6868. Training is provided!</p>
<p><b>THANK YOU, PEMCO, FROM THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN</b>.
This last Wednesday, December 15, PEMCO Insurance
Company provided a holiday party for 150+ of our
guests. Their volunteers prepared and served the meal
with live Christmas music. Santa showed up for the
festivities to offer his good cheer and gift
certificates. Also, Botanical Gardens gave us 25 beautiful
poinsettias. Thank you and a peaceful Christmas to all,
from the Cathedral Kitchen Crew.</p>
<p><b>CANDLELIGHT, CAROLS AND CATHEDRAL CHILDREN
EVENT IS FREE</b>. Given the economy and the generosity
of donors, we are inviting everyone to attend without
having to purchase reserve seating passes. This
beautiful St. James tradition features our young lectors
reading scripture, our celebrated youth choirs singing
carols from around the world, and you singing
congregational favorites for the season. Sunday,

the day speak to you in your everyday life. The study
will finish in time to attend 5:30 Mass. Young adults

<p><b>YOUNG ADULTS “WARM HEARTS AND SOLES”</b> 7th annual Advent sock drive for 
homeless men continues today, Sunday, December 19. Your generosity is warming 
our hearts – we are doing well, but short of our goal of 2010 pairs for delivery 
in January to warm the soles of those in need. Advent is coming to a close, but 
let’s keep up our efforts by dropping off new socks at the Young Adult table in 
Cathedral Hall after 8:00am, 10:00am, and 12:00 Sunday Masses – AND you can 
continue to drop off sock donations during the week at 2nd floor Cathedral 
Place. Such a worthwhile project – let’s keep those hearts and soles warm this 
winter! <i>Information</i>

<p><b>ARE YOU A CATHOLIC WHO HAS BEEN AWAY FROM
THE CHURCH?</b> Our Welcome Back program provides
a safe place, in the company of others who are also
examining their faith, to ask questions about returning
to regular church attendance, to the sacraments, and to
learn about changes in the church. The sessions are
offered on Mondays, January 3 through April 4, 7:00-9:00pm on 2nd floor Cathedral Place. Classes are
offered without any obligation. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH?</b> You are invited to
participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the
Catholic community of faith. It is a process which
encompasses the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching,
and Christian values—the development and deepening
of a life of prayer and action—all with the support and
involvement of the parish community. A new inquiry
session will begin on Wednesday, January 12.

<p><b>FINDING HOPE IN A TOPSY-TURVY JOB MARKET</b>:
Principles and Tools to Jump Start your Job Search.
Beginning in January a two part series of classes will be
offered during the coming year that will incorporate
efforts to search for a job within a context of faith and
hope. Part one, which will take place on the first
Tuesday evening of each month, will focus on the
principles and tools needed for effective job searching,
including resume writing, interviewing techniques and
networking. Part two, which will take place on the third
Sunday morning of each month (following the 10:00 am
Mass), will focus on the application of concepts learned
in part one, including sharing strategies and struggles
with real life experiences of looking for a job. Sessions
will be facilitated by parishioners who are professionals
in this field. <i>Information</i>,
