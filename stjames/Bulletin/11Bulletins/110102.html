<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>PARISH OFFICE CLOSED</b>. On Monday, January 3, 2011,
the Parish Office will be closed in observance of New
Year’s Day. Masses in the Cathedral will follow the
usual weekday schedule.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU A CATHOLIC WHO HAS BEEN AWAY FROM
THE CHURCH?</b> Our Welcome Back program provides
a safe place, in the company of others who are also
examining their faith, to ask questions about returning
to regular church attendance, to the sacraments, and to
learn about changes in the church. The sessions are
offered on Mondays, January 3 through April 4, 7:00-9:00pm on 2nd floor Cathedral Place. Classes are
offered without any obligation. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH?</b> You are invited to
participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the
Catholic community of faith. It is a process which
encompasses the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching,
and Christian values—the development and deepening
of a life of prayer and action—all with the support and
involvement of the parish community. A new inquiry
session will begin on Wednesday, January 12.

<p><b>FINDING HOPE IN A TOPSY-TURVY JOB MARKET:
PRINCIPLES AND TOOLS TO JUMP START YOUR JOB
SEARCH</b>.
Beginning in January, a two-part series of classes will be
offered during the coming year that will incorporate
efforts to search for a job within a context of faith and
hope. Part one, which will take place on the first
Tuesday evening of each month, will focus on the
principles and tools needed for effective job searching,
including resume writing, interviewing techniques and
networking. Part two, which will take place on the third
Sunday morning of each month (following the 10:00 am
Mass), will focus on the application of concepts learned
in part one, including sharing strategies and struggles
with real life experiences of looking for a job. Sessions
will be facilitated by parishioners who are professionals
in this field. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A WAY TO HELP OTHERS AS
A NEW YEAR BEGINS WHILE ALSO LEARNING MORE
ABOUT YOUR CATHOLIC FAITH?</b> Consider being a
sponsor for one of our many new inquirers coming to
participate in our Christian Initiation process to learn
more about the Catholic Church (RCIA). We need St.
James parishioners to be companions with our new
inquirers to help welcome them to our community. All
training and support will be provided and the time
commitment is reasonable—a minimum of 2 sessions a
month (Wednesday evenings). To learn more, come to
our Sponsor Information meeting on Wednesday,
January 12 from 7:00-9:00 pm at Cathedral Place,
second floor. The rewards are many, including
renewal and update of your faith and “kudos” in
heaven. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. <i>Please note that babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses</i>.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never
officially registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to
register</i>. Registered parishioners receive important
mailings from the Cathedral (including offering
envelopes!), are regular recipients of the Cathedral’s
quarterly journal <i>In Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate
their wedding at the Cathedral, and their children may
attend any of the five Catholic Rainbow Schools at
parishioner rates (and become eligible for Cathedral
scholarship money). In addition, if you are a registered
parishioner and use envelopes, or are on the direct
debit program, we will mail you a quarterly report of
your contributions to the parish. Registration cards can
be found in the vestibule. Please drop the completed
card in the collection basket or put it in the mail. <i>If
you’re not sure whether you’re registered at St. James,
call the parish office at 206-622-3559</i>.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30 pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight,
and the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé
in France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect
way to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>ARCHBISHOP HUNTHAUSEN LIBRARY</b>. Visit your
friendly and accessible Archbishop Hunthausen
Library in Cathedral Hall during the Sunday coffee
hours. We have a good selection of old favorites and
recent releases.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Elizabeth
Ann Seton in Bothell, and St. Mary in Castle Rock and
Centralia.</p>
