<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James is
proud to welcome visitors from near and far
throughout the summer months. Each week a
drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from
among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your
address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and
drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your
presence in our midst today. <b>Last week, we had visitors
from McKinney, TX; Duluth, GA; Cardiff, United
Kingdom, and many other places! The winner of our
drawing was from Flemington, NJ</b>.</i></p>
<p><b>SUMMER TOURS</b>. During the summer months, June, July,

Wednesday at 1:00pm. This is a great opportunity to
share your Cathedral with out-of-town guests. No

<p><b>SUMMER FILM FESTIVAL—“OF GODS AND MEN”</b> Join
us on Tuesday, July 12 in Cathedral Place, 2nd floor at
7:00pm to watch this critically acclaimed film. It
centers on the monastery of Tibhirine, where nine
Trappist monks lived in harmony with the largely
Muslim population of Algeria, until seven of them were
kidnapped and assassinated in 1996 during the Algerian
Civil War. (Rated R) <i>This is the movie Father Ryan
talked about in his homily on Easter Sunday</i>. Popcorn
and lemonade will be provided and you are welcome to
bring your favorite movie treats. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL CONFERENCES</b> of St.
James thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During June, we made 50 home
visits to our low income neighbors and continued to
focus on preventing homelessness. Your contributions
made it possible for us to help 33 families and
individuals stay in their homes, and 15 households
avoid utility shot-offs, In addition, we provided food
and furniture to 20 households, and supplied 10 St.
Vincent de Paul Thrift Store vouchers for housewares
and clothing. Members of the St. Vincent de Paul
Society follow Jesus through service to those in need.
Bearing witness to Christ’s compassionate and
liberating love, we show our commitment through
person-to-person contact. Home visits are always made
in pairs. As calls for help increase, we actively seek
new members. Please consider joining this beautiful
ministry to the poor among us. <i>Information</i>, Rob Millar
