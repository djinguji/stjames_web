<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Back in September, one-thousand of our parish households were invited to
participate in a survey on our Cathedral parish. We are grateful for the large
number who responded. It has taken some time and effort to sift through a
mountain of data but we are now in a position to share the results with you.</p>
<p>If I had to sum up the survey in a sentence, it would be this: you like
your parish, you support it, and you feel that you are a part of its life and
ministry. (Heavens, some of you even seem to like your pastor!) And even
though we are a very large parish and pray in a very large building, by far the
majority of you feel that St. James is a community, your community; you know
that your presence and participation are vital to the life of this community, and
you are happy to be part of it.</p>
<p>In my view, that is no small achievement, nor is it typical of cathedral
parishes across our country.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this—and they emerge quite clearly in
the survey responses. You love the way the Church’s liturgy is celebrated in the
Cathedral, you value very highly the service, outreach, and social justice
orientation of the parish, and you appreciate the many opportunities provided
for growing in the understanding of your faith.</p>
<p>Of course, there are challenges, too, and some indications of
dissatisfaction. Because we are such a large parish, sometimes it can feel too
big, even impersonal. And many of you, who come from long distances to pray
here on Sundays, find it difficult to get back during the week and take part in all
the other activities that make this place what it is.</p>
<p>Our Pastoral Vision Council, as well as our parish staff, have reviewed
all the data and the feedback which you provided, and the results will shape a
new vision statement for the parish. We think this will be a good starting place
for some honest self-evaluation as well as an opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking part in the survey. I hope you will take some
time to review the results. And I hope that doing so will make you want to
become even more involved in the life of our wonderful parish!</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

SCHOOL STUDENTS</b>. Our parish has established a

Rainbow Schools (Sts. George, Edward, Paul,
Therese, and Joseph). Applications are now available
for the 2011 school year. Families are required to be
registered in our parish, have a Sacrificial Giving card
on file (whether they are able to make a monetary
pledge or not), and active in the parish in some
capacity. Applications are due April 30. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b> is up and running!
Your friendly Cathedral baristas will be serving espresso
drinks after the 10:00 Mass. <i>During the month of
February all proceeds will benefit the Homeless
Ministry and Operation Nightwatch</i>.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never
officially registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to
register</i>. Registered parishioners receive important
mailings from the Cathedral (including offering
envelopes!), are regular recipients of the Cathedral’s
quarterly journal <i>In Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate
their wedding at the Cathedral, and their children may
attend any of the five Catholic Rainbow Schools at
parishioner rates (and become eligible for Cathedral
scholarship money). In addition, if you are a registered
parishioner and use envelopes, or are on the direct
debit program, we will mail you a quarterly report of
your contributions to the parish. Registration cards can
be found in the vestibule. Please drop the completed
card in the collection basket or put it in the mail. <i>If
you’re not sure whether you’re registered at St. James,
call the parish office at 206-622-3559</i>.</p>

<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight,
and the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect
way to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>SICK OR HOMEBOUND?</b> If you or someone you know
is seriously ill, hospitalized or homebound, and would
like to receive communion calls or are in need of the
sacrament of Anointing of the Sick, please call

Simpson</a>, 206-274-3173.</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. <i>Please note that babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses</i>.</p>

<p><b>FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS AT THE ALTAR</b>. Floral
offerings are a venerable custom in the Church, and a
wonderful way to remember a deceased loved one,
celebrate an anniversary, or give thanks for an
answered prayer. <i>Information</i>
