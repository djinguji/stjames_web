<p align="center"><font face="Papyrus" size="5">JOURNEY OF THE ELECT</font></p>
<p>This week we celebrate the third and final Scrutiny
with the Gospel story of the raising of Lazarus.
Death is our greatest fear and this story reminds us
that God’s power and mercy are greater than ANY
fear, sin or pain that we have in our lives. The
Elect are asked to think about what needs to die in
their lives in order for them to receive the new life
being offered to them in baptism. For some, the
question of whether they even want to come out of
the tomb is important, whether they are willing to
risk coming out into the light of Christ to see what
awaits them. This week they will also be
presented with The Lord’s Prayer, which teaches
us that God loves as a loving father and will “give
us …our daily bread” and “lead us from
temptation.” As they approach these last days of
preparation before baptism, keep them in your
prayers.</p>

<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND/OR BECOMING
CATHOLIC?</b> You are invited to participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the Catholic
community of faith. It is a process which encompasses
the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching, and Christian
values—the development and deepening of a life of
prayer and action—all with the support and
involvement of the parish community. You can learn
more by going to the <a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA">RCIA 
website</a>.
A new inquiry session will begin Wednesday, May 11

<p><b>ARE YOU A CATHOLIC WHO HAS BEEN AWAY FROM
THE CHURCH?</b> Our Welcome Back program provides
a safe place, in the company of others who are also
examining their faith, to ask questions about returning
to regular church attendance, returning to the
sacraments, and to learn about changes in the
church. The sessions are offered on Mondays, May 2
through August 1, 7:00-9:00pm on 2nd floor Cathedral
Place. Classes are offered without any
obligation. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>THE ST. VINCENT DE PAUL CONFERENCES</b> of St.
James thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations. During March we received significantly
more requests for help. Preventing homelessness
continued to be our major work. We made a total of 80
home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions allowed us to feed and forestall the
evictions of 46 families; supply 12 households with
clothes, baby items and housewares; give beds to 4
people, and help one family with utilities. We actively
seek new members. <i>Information</i>, Rob Millar 206-954-8902 and Tammy Bendix 206-595-9158.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Catherine in
Seattle and the Mission Churches of St. Catherine in Cathlamet and Concrete.</p>
