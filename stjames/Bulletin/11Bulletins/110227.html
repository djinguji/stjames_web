from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

<p><b>SAVE THE DATE</b>. This year’s Environmental Health

Masses. The theme is <i><b>Healthy People - Healthy
Planet</b></i>. Exhibitors include the American Lung
Association, Dental Health, Earth Ministry, Poison
Control, several chiropractors, naturopaths and
massage therapists and more.</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. For those who wish, babysitting is available in the Mother Cabrini Room 
at the Pastoral Outreach Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</p>
