<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James is
proud to welcome visitors from near and far
throughout the summer months. Each week a
drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from
among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your
address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and
drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your
presence in our midst today. <b>Last week, we had visitors
from Tolleson, AZ; Sterling Heights, MI, and many
other places! The winner of our drawing was from
Memphis, TN</b>.</i></p>
<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b> are in thanksgiving for
the Musicians of St. James Cathedral! <i>Floral offerings are a wonderful way to 
remember a deceased loved one, celebrate an anniversary, or give thanks for a 
prayer that has been answered. If you have been inspired to give thanks with 
flowers, please contact
<a href="mailto:pbehnken@stjames-cathedral.org?subject=Flowers at the Altar">
Peggy Behnken</a> at 206-654-4650</i>.</p>
<p><b>INDEPENDENCE DAY HOLIDAY</b>. On Monday, July 4,
the parish office will be closed in observance of the
holiday. There will be only one Mass in the Cathedral,
at 9:00am. The Cathedral will close immediately
following the Mass.</p>
<p><b>SUMMER TOURS</b>. During the summer months, June, July,
and August, we offer a tour of the Cathedral each
Wednesday at 1:00pm. This is a great opportunity to
share your Cathedral with out-of-town guests. No
reservations are necessary; gather in the west vestibule.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight, and
the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect way
to end a busy week.</p>

<p><b>SUMMER FILM FESTIVAL—“OF GODS AND MEN”</b> Join
us on Tuesday, July 12 in Cathedral Place, 2nd floor at
7:00pm to watch this critically acclaimed film. It
centers on the monastery of Tibhirine, where nine
Trappist monks lived in harmony with the largely
Muslim population of Algeria, until seven of them were
kidnapped and assassinated in 1996 during the Algerian
Civil War. (Rated R) <i>This is the movie Father Ryan
talked about in his homily on Easter Sunday</i>. Popcorn
and lemonade will be provided and you are welcome to
bring your favorite movie treats. <i>Information</i>,

We are looking for several outgoing people to help
with set-up, serving and clean-up for this very
