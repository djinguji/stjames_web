<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James is
proud to welcome visitors from near and far
throughout the summer months. Each week a
drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from
among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your
address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and
drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your
presence in our midst today. <b>Last week, we had visitors
from Perth, Australia; Anchorage, AK; Springfield,
LA, and many other places! The winner of our
drawing was from Keizer, OR</b>.</i></p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from Seattle University in
honor of the Class of 2011, and from the Archdiocese of
Seattle in thanksgiving for our five newly ordained
priests. <i>Floral offerings are a 
wonderful way to remember a deceased loved one, celebrate an anniversary, or 
give thanks for a prayer that has been answered. If you have been inspired to 
give thanks with flowers, please contact

<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b> is up and running!
Your friendly Cathedral baristas will be serving espresso
drinks after the 10:00 Mass. During the month of June,
all proceeds will go towards scholarships for the Schola
Cantorum Choir Camp. Try our special drink of the
month: the Jubi-latte!</p>
<p><b>SUMMER TOURS</b>. During the summer months, June, July,
and August, we offer a tour of the Cathedral each
Wednesday at 1:00pm. This is a great opportunity to
share your Cathedral with out-of-town guests. No
reservations are necessary; gather in the west vestibule.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight, and
the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect way
to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>SUMMER FILM FESTIVAL</b>. Join us Tuesday, June 14 for
the return of this popular summer series in Cathedral
Place, 2nd floor at 7:00pm. Our first film, co-sponsored
by our ESL program, is entitled <i>Innocent
Voices</i>—it is an inspirational coming-of-age story of
screenwriter Oscar Torres, who, as an 11-year-old boy,
was caught up in the El Salvador’s civil war. The movie is
principally about the effects of war on children (in
Spanish with subtitles—rated R). Popcorn and
lemonade will be provided and you are welcome to
bring your favorite movie treats. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>YOUTH MIGRANT PROJECT MISSION TRIP 2011</b>. It is not too late for high 
school students to sign up for a week of service and fun as we work with migrant 
workers and their families. Opportunities include working with children in the 
daycare, and assisting at the food and clothing banks. Don’t miss out!! <i>

<p><b>COFFEE HOUR HOSPITALITY NEEDS YOU!</b> As we
move into the warmer summer weather, we will again
be offering hospitality “al fresco” in the Archbishop
Murphy courtyard following the Sunday morning
masses. But we need your help to make this happen!
We are looking for several outgoing people to help
with set-up, serving and clean-up for this very
important ministry of hospitality. We especially need
help following the 12:00 mass. It’s a lot of fun, and a
minimal time commitment. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>THE ST. VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank Cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During May, we made a total of
79 home visits to our low income neighbors. We
continued to focus the majority of our efforts on
preventing homelessness: your contributions made it
possible for us to keep 37 individuals and families in
their homes. We also provided food for 18 households;
helped pay heat and utilities for 7 families; and gave
out 20 vouchers to the St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Store
for beds and furniture, housewares, and other items. As
requests for help steadily increase, we are seeking new
members to help meet the growing need. Please
consider joining this deeply rewarding ministry to the
poor among us. <i>Information</i>, Rob Millar 206-954-8902

<p><b>CHOIR CAMP</b>. St. James Cathedral's Youth Music
Program is now registering students in grades 4-8
(treble voices) for our annual Choir Camp, August 15-21. This exciting week-long camp provides children
training in music fundamentals, Orff instruments, and
proper singing techniques; and fosters their active
participation in the liturgy through music. <i>For audition
and general information</i>,

<p><b>
<img border="0" src="../../images/Rosehedge.png" align="right">REACH OUT TO SOMEONE SUFFERING
FROM HIV/AIDS, MS OR ADDICTION</b>.
People struggling to recover from
illness need more than a good doctor.
They need the care and concern of a
supportive community. St. James
parishioners work in partnership with the Rosehedge
Multifaith Works to form CareTeams that offer
practical and emotional support to people isolated by
their illness and cut off from the community.
CareTeam training will be held Saturday, June 18, 8:45
am to 4:45 pm at the Rosehedge Multifaith Works
Office, 115 – 16th Avenue, Seattle. <i>Information</i>,

Kitchen</b>. Please turn in your pledge TODAY and be a part of this important 
Appeal. You may make a onetime gift or spread your gift out over as many as ten
