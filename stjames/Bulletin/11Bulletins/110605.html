<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James is
proud to welcome visitors from near and far
throughout the summer months. Each week a
drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from
among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your
address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and
drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your
presence in our midst today. <b>Last week, we had visitors
from Rensselaer, NY; Montrose, CO; Guadalajara,
Mexico, and many other places! The winner of our
drawing was from Honolulu, Hawaii</b>.</i></p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from Emma Deuna Lopez
in loving memory of Armando E. Deuna and Peregrina
L. Gambalan on the anniversary of their deaths. <i>Floral offerings are a 
wonderful way to remember a deceased loved one, celebrate an anniversary, or 
give thanks for a prayer that has been answered. If you have been inspired to 
give thanks with flowers, please contact
<a href="mailto:pbehnken@stjamescathedral.org?subject=Flowers at the Altar">

<p><b>GUEST CHOIR SATURDAY 5:30</b>. We welcome the choir
of Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, Mercer Island, directed
by Chrade Younkin, with organist David Locke.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight, and
the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect way
to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>SENIOR TEA</b>. Our annual Senior Tea will take place on
Thursday, June 9. Invitations were sent to all our
Cathedral Parishioners 75 and older this week. <i>If you did
not receive your invitation, but would like to attend</i>,
contact <a href="mailto:jsimpson@stjames-cathedral.org?subject=Senior Tea">John Simpson</a>, 206-274-3173.</p>

<p><b>SUMMER FILM FESTIVAL</b>. Join us Tuesday, June 14 for
the return of this popular summer series in Cathedral
Place, 2nd floor at 7:00pm. Our first film, co-sponsored
by our ESL program, is entitled <i>Innocent
Voices</i>—it is an inspirational coming-of-age story of
screenwriter Oscar Torres, who, as an 11-year-old boy,
was caught up in the El Salvador’s civil war. His saga
is harrowing and intensely moving. The movie is
principally about the effects of war on children (in
Spanish with subtitles—rated R). Popcorn and
lemonade will be provided and you are welcome to
bring your favorite movie treats. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>COFFEE HOUR HOSPITALITY NEEDS YOU!</b> As we
move into the warmer summer weather, we will again
be offering hospitality “al fresco” in the Archbishop
Murphy courtyard following the Sunday morning
masses. But we need your help to make this happen!
We are looking for several outgoing people to help
with set-up, serving and clean-up for this very
important ministry of hospitality. We especially need
help following the 12:00 mass. It’s a lot of fun, and a
minimal time commitment. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>
<img border="0" src="../../images/Rosehedge.png" align="right">REACH OUT TO SOMEONE SUFFERING
FROM HIV/AIDS, MS OR ADDICTION</b>.
People struggling to recover from
illness need more than a good doctor.
They need the care and concern of a
supportive community. St. James
parishioners work in partnership with the Rosehedge
Multifaith Works to form CareTeams that offer
practical and emotional support to people isolated by
their illness and cut off from the community.
CareTeam training will be held Saturday, June 18, 8:45
am to 4:45 pm at the Rosehedge Multifaith Works
Office, 115 – 16th Avenue, Seattle. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>NEED PASTORAL CARE?</b> Whether you are sick or homebound and in need of 
communion, or would like a CD of Sunday’s Mass, or need the sacrament of the 
Anointing of the Sick, we can help!

<p><b>SUMMER TOURS</b>. During the summer months, June,
July, and August, we offer a tour of the Cathedral each
Wednesday at 1:00pm. This is a great opportunity to
share your Cathedral with out-of-town guests. No
reservations are necessary; gather in the west vestibule.</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. For those who wish, babysitting is available
in the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</p>
<p><b>LISTENING ASSISTANCE DEVICES</b>. If you have trouble
hearing the spoken word in the Cathedral, ask an usher
about using one of our listening assistance devices,
which provide clear and clean sound. Not just for the
hard of hearing!</p>
