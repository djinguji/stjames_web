<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b> is up and running!
Your friendly Cathedral baristas will be serving espresso
drinks after the 10:00 Mass. <i>During the month of April
all proceeds benefit St. James RCIA</i>.</p>
<p><b>NEW IN THE BOOKSTORE</b>. The Women of St. James Schola have released their first CD, 
<i>Century of Chant</i>.
Stop in to get a copy (or two!) today. Also: we have
Archbishop Sartain’s book, <i>Of You My Heart Has
Spoken</i>, back in stock. Also: reading for Holy Week and Easter, and titles by 
our Tre Ore speaker for this year,
Irish Dominican Paul Murray.</p>
<p><b>FINDING HOPE IN A TOPSY-TURVY JOB MARKET</b>:

<p><b>PUBLIC FAST FOR A JUST AND COMPASSIONATE
BUDGET</b>. This year, Holy Week coincides with the last
week of the scheduled legislative session in Olympia.
One of the core principles of Catholic Social Teaching is
that economic decisions must be judged in light of their
effect on the poor. The budget debates at the state and
federal level threaten to cut services to our most
vulnerable brothers and sisters. During Holy Week, we
have an opportunity to combine our Lenten practices of
prayer and fasting with a particular focus on seeking a
budget that reflects justice. The Church Council of
Greater Seattle is organizing public fasts at the state
capital in Olympia; information can be found at
<a class="navy" target="_bulletin" href="http://www.thechurchcouncil.org/fast.htm">www.thechurchcouncil.org/fast.htm</a>. Even if you cannot
participate in the public fast, please consider uniting
your prayer and fasting during Holy Week with the
cause of a just and compassionate budget. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE
CATHOLIC CHURCH AND/OR BECOMING CATHOLIC?</b>
You are invited to participate in the RCIA, a process of
initiation into the Catholic community of faith. It is a
process which encompasses the study of Scripture,
Catholic teaching, and Christian values—the
development and deepening of a life of prayer and
action—all with the support and involvement of the
parish community. You can learn more by going to
the <a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA">RCIA website</a>. A new inquiry
session will begin Wednesday, May 11 at 7:00 pm in
Cathedral Place, second floor. <i>Information</i>,

lives where we, the baptized, will also renew our
baptismal promises as we celebrate the resurrection
of our Lord.</p>
