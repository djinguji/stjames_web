<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

wedding of Brigitte Rassilyer and Jeffrey Krier. <i>Floral offerings are a 
wonderful way to remember a deceased loved one, celebrate an anniversary, or 
give thanks for a prayer that has been answered. Information,
