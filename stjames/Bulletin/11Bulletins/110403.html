<p align="center"><font face="Papyrus" size="5">JOURNEY OF THE ELECT</font></p>
<p>This week we celebrate the second of the three
Scrutinies with the retelling of the story of the man
born blind. This Gospel challenges our Elect to
reflect more deeply upon their lives, with particular
focus on the “blind spots” that prevent them from
even seeing the effects of sin and evil in their lives
and in the lives of others. Later this week, the
Elect will be presented with our Creed. The
Church “lovingly entrust to them…this ancient text
that has always been regarded as expressing the
heart of the Church’s faith and prayer.” The Creed
is presented in order to enlighten the Elect and it
recalls the wonderful deeds of God for the
salvation of the human race. The Elect are to
commit the Creed to memory and will recite it
publicly on Holy Saturday. Continue to enter into
these solemn rites in prayer with our Elect as they
prepare for baptism, Eucharist and confirmation,
and to pray for them every day, for your prayers do
make a difference!</p>
