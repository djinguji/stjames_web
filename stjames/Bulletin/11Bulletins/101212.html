<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH?</b> You are invited to
participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the
Catholic community of faith. It is a process which
encompasses the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching,
and Christian values—the development and deepening
of a life of prayer and action—all with the support and
involvement of the parish community. A new inquiry
session will begin on Wednesday, January 12.

<p><b>FINDING HOPE IN A TOPSY-TURVY JOB MARKET:
PRINCIPLES AND TOOLS TO JUMP START YOUR JOB
SEARCH</b>. Beginning in January a two part series of
classes will be offered during the coming year that will
incorporate efforts to search for a job within a context of
faith and hope. Part one, which will take place on the
first Tuesday evening of each month, will focus on the
principles and tools needed for effective job searching,
including resume writing, interviewing techniques and
networking. Part two, which will take place on the third
Sunday morning of each month (following the 10:00am
Mass), will focus on the application of concepts learned
in part one, including sharing strategies and struggles
with real life experiences of looking for a job. Sessions
will be facilitated by parishioners who are professionals
in this field. <i>More details in next week’s bulletin</i>.</p>
<p><b>YOUNG ADULTS (21 - 30-something)</b> Come one and all to join together at 
the sock drive table following the 8:00, 10:00, and Noon Masses for the Sundays 
in Advent. Meet and greet each other as you spread the enthusiasm among 
parishioners donating socks for the homeless. It is a great way to get to know 
each other! <i>Information</i>

<p><b>YOUNG ADULTS “WARM HEARTS AND SOLES”</b> 7th
annual Advent sock drive for homeless men continues
today, Sunday, December 12. Your generosity is
warming our hearts – we are currently at 47% of our
goal of 2010 pairs for delivery in January to warm the
soles of those in need. Advent will be drawing to a
close before we know it, so let’s keep up our efforts by
dropping off new socks at the Young Adult table in
Cathedral Hall after 8:00am, 10:00am, and 12:00
Sunday Masses, or during the week at 2nd floor
Cathedral Place. Such a worthwhile project – let’s
keep those hearts and soles warm this
winter! <i>Information</i>

examining their faith, to ask questions about returning
to regular church attendance, to the sacraments, and to
learn about changes in the church. The sessions are
offered on Mondays, January 3 through April 4, 7:00-9:00pm on 2nd floor Cathedral Place. Classes are
offered without any obligation. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. <i>Please note that babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses</i>.</p>
<p><b>WINTER SHELTER NEEDS</b> new or used hand towels,
disposable razors, mouth wash, spray deodorant and
toothbrushes. Please drop off your donations in the
blue bin set out during all coffee hours or at the parish
office during business hours.</p>
