	<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Easter was a long time in coming this year, but it has finally arrived. 
Perhaps we should be grateful for a late Easter if for no other reason that the 
weather has been so unlike Easter! As I write this some days before Easter, I 
have no idea what sort of weather will greet us on April 24 but we do live in 
hope....</p>
<p>It is a joy to be able to welcome you to St. James Cathedral on this Easter 
of 2011. I do so in the name of our new Archbishop, J. Peter Sartain, as well as 
in my own.</p>
<p>Of all the times we gather as Christian believers, none is more important 
than this one. Easter is the greatest of all our feasts. It celebrates the 
Mystery that is the very foundation of our Christian faith, for, as St. Paul 
wrote, “<i>If Christ has not risen, our faith is in vain</i>.” (1 Cor. 15:14)</p>
<p>But Christ has risen and your presence here in the Cathedral both affirms and 
celebrates that most startling and enduring of all realities. While we do not 
see him, we know he lives and that he is in our midst breathing life and hope 
into us, walking along-side us on our pilgrimage of faith, our journey toward 
the Kingdom.</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing what is in your heart as you come here on this 
Easter Sunday. For some, I am sure, there is joy and a keen sense of hope that 
is echoed in the Spring that is bursting all around us; for others, there may be 
the burden of pain that comes from losing a job or from serious illness, or the 
grief that comes from the death of a loved one. For others, this may be the 
Easter that you decided to reclaim the practice of your Catholic faith—or at 
least to explore that possibility. No matter why you came or what you bring with 
you this Easter day, I hope you know that you are welcome at St. James 
Cathedral, and I hope that you find something here that will comfort you, 
challenge you, and give you hope. We live in a world that, while incredibly 
beautiful, is also seriously flawed. Death and life are never very far away from 
us. But Easter boldly proclaims that death is not the whole story. Easter 
proclaims for all to hear that death does not have the last word. Life does!</p>
<p>My prayer today is that you will be renewed in faith and hope as you join in 
worship here at St. James Cathedral.</p>
<p>If you are a visitor, please know that you are warmly welcomed here. I hope 
you will find something today that will touch your heart, awaken your spirit, 
and make you want to return to this holy place again and again. If you are part 
of the regular family of St. James, I take this opportunity to thank you for all 
the ways you make the Risen Lord Jesus present in this parish and in this city: 
through your prayer, your faith, and your love that overflows in such generous 
and unselfish service, especially to the poor.</p>
<p>May the blessings of the Risen Lord Jesus be yours in abundance.</p>
