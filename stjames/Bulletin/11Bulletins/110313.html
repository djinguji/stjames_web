<p align="center"><font face="Papyrus" size="5">JOURNEY OF THE ELECT</font></p>
<p>Beginning this week, those preparing to be baptized
at the Easter Vigil (our newly <i>Elect</i>) are wearing
brown or red robes while attending Mass and other
liturgies in the cathedral. This helps them to know,
in a concrete way, that they have entered a new and
significant stage in their final preparations for
Easter. It also anticipates another significant
moment that will take place when they emerge from
the baptismal waters at the Easter Vigil and change
into white robes. Seek them out in our midst and, if
possible, introduce yourself to them after Mass. Let
them know you are praying for them and looking
forward to Easter when they will join us at the
Eucharistic table.</p>
<p><b>LENTEN PRAYER PARTNERS FOR THE ELECT</b>. The
Church tells us that it is the <i>entire</i> parish’s
responsibility to support and welcome those
preparing for baptism this Easter. One of the many
ways you can do this is to become a prayer partner
for one of our Elect. You are asked to pray
everyday for him/her during Lent, asking for God’s
blessings and guidance. Also, notes and cards will
be collected during Holy Week to be given to the
Elect before Easter. Prayer cards are available at the
place of prayer located in the north aisle of the west
nave of the Cathedral (where you can also learn
more about each of them in our Book of the Elect),
in the bookstore, and in Cathedral Hall during
Sunday morning hospitality. You can also meet our
Elect on our <a href="../../Events/2011/bookoftheelect.htm">parish website</a>. Your prayers make a difference!!! <i>Information</i>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Patrick in
Seattle and Tacoma, and St. Patrick Mission in Dockton.</p>
