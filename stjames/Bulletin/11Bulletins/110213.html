	<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Back in September, one-thousand of our parish households were invited to
participate in a survey on our Cathedral parish. We are grateful for the large
number who responded. It has taken some time and effort to sift through a
mountain of data but we are now in a position to share the results with you.</p>
<p>If I had to sum up the survey in a sentence, it would be this: you like
your parish, you support it, and you feel that you are a part of its life and
ministry. (Heavens, some of you even seem to like your pastor!) And even
though we are a very large parish and pray in a very large building, by far the
majority of you feel that St. James is a community, your community; you know
that your presence and participation are vital to the life of this community, and
you are happy to be part of it.</p>
<p>In my view, that is no small achievement, nor is it typical of cathedral
parishes across our country.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this—and they emerge quite clearly in
the survey responses. You love the way the Church’s liturgy is celebrated in the
Cathedral, you value very highly the service, outreach, and social justice
orientation of the parish, and you appreciate the many opportunities provided
for growing in the understanding of your faith.</p>
<p>Of course, there are challenges, too, and some indications of
dissatisfaction. Because we are such a large parish, sometimes it can feel too
big, even impersonal. And many of you, who come from long distances to pray
here on Sundays, find it difficult to get back during the week and take part in all
the other activities that make this place what it is.</p>
<p>Our Pastoral Vision Council, as well as our parish staff, have reviewed
all the data and the feedback which you provided, and the results will shape a
new vision statement for the parish. We think this will be a good starting place
for some honest self-evaluation as well as an opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking part in the survey. I hope you will take some
time to review the results. And I hope that doing so will make you want to
become even more involved in the life of our wonderful parish!</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b> is up and running!
Your friendly Cathedral baristas will be serving espresso
drinks after the 10:00 Mass. <i>During the month of
February all proceeds will benefit the Homeless
Ministry and Operation Nightwatch</i>.</p>
<p><b>NEW ON THE WEBSITE</b>. Staff member Suzanne Lee’s
meditation for the <a href="../../Pubs/Pastor/massforlife.htm">Day of Prayer for Life</a> 
is available online. You can also find out about coming events at the Cathedral, 
view photo albums of recent events, and much more! </p>
<p><b>THE SOCIETY OF ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b> is a worldwide
Catholic organization that has been at St. James Parish
since 1922. The vocation of the Society’s volunteers,
who are called Vincentians, is to follow Jesus through
service to those in need and so bear witness to Christ’s
compassionate and liberating love. Volunteers show
their commitment through visiting the poor in their
homes. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul sincerely
thanks our parishioners for their generous donations last
month. During January, we made a total of <b>42</b> visits to
our neighbors in need. Your contributions allowed us to
forestall <b>45</b> evictions, feed <b>nine</b> families, deliver beds
and furniture to <b>eight</b> households, provide clothes for
<b>two</b> people, and offer budget advice to <b>one</b> family. The
need is great. We could serve even more people with
<i>your</i> help! <i>Information regarding SVdP volunteer
opportunities</i>,

<p><b>HELP A NEIGHBOR IN NEED</b>. Many people in our
community need help with transportation, shopping,
laundry, and housework. Advanced age, chronic
illness and financial difficulties can prevent our
neighbors from accomplishing these routine daily
tasks. By volunteering just a few hours a month with
Volunteer Chore Services, you can help someone stay
in his or her own home, avoiding the need to move to
an institutional setting. To learn more about VCS, plan
to attend a brief information session on Sunday,
February 20 from 11:15 to 11:45am in the Mother
Mary Rose Room of the Pastoral Outreach Center
(907 Columbia). <i>Information</i>

Saturday, February 26 at 8:00 pm at the Moore
Theatre. One day only! It is presented by the
Fellowship for the Performing Arts whose mission is
to produce theatre from a Christian worldview that is
engaging to a diverse audience. The inspiring drama,
starring Max McLean, is a smart, provocative and
wickedly funny theatrical adaptation of C.S. Lewis’
novel about spiritual warfare from a demon’s point of
view. <i>The Screwtape Letters</i>’ success is due to its
piercing insight into human nature and the lucid and
humorous way Lewis makes his readers squirm in self
recognition. Tickets $44/person. Only a limited
number of tickets available so don’t delay. <i>Information</i>,

families and individuals who are experiencing poverty
and homelessness. All St. James parish members are
invited to join Catholic social service and justice
organizations Thursday, March 24, 9am–3pm at the
State Capitol in Olympia to promote a state budget
that safeguards the least among us. Following a policy
briefing, participants will visit their local legislators
for scheduled appointments. A free chartered bus for
registered participants will depart from Seattle and
Tacoma. <i>To register</i>, contact the

<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never
officially registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to
register</i>. Registered parishioners receive important
mailings from the Cathedral (including offering
envelopes!), are regular recipients of the Cathedral’s
quarterly journal <i>In Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate
their wedding at the Cathedral, and their children may
attend any of the five Catholic Rainbow Schools at
parishioner rates (and become eligible for Cathedral
scholarship money). In addition, if you are a registered
parishioner and use envelopes, or are on the direct
debit program, we will mail you a quarterly report of
your contributions to the parish. Registration cards can
be found in the vestibule. Please drop the completed
card in the collection basket or put it in the mail. <i>If
you’re not sure whether you’re registered at St. James,
call the parish office at 206-622-3559</i>.</p>

<p><b>WINTER SHELTER NEEDS</b> new or used hand towels,
disposable razors and toothbrushes. Please drop off
your donations in the blue bin set out during all coffee
hours or at the parish office during business hours.</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. <i>Please note that babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses</i>.</p>

<p><b>BLACK HISTORY MONTH</b>. In celebration of Black
History Month, the African, African American, Black
Catholic Ministry of the Archdiocese of Seattle invites
you to a three-day workshop on “Spiritual Fitness” with
Sister Judy Gomila, MSC. This is workout to develop
“faith-filled heart muscle”—no running shoes
necessary! The retreat will be held at Immaculate
Conception Church, Seattle, February 18-20.

to postpone or achieve pregnancy. Natural Family
Planning is a very simple method which is 99%
effective, and has no harmful side effects. It can also
help to strengthen marriages. Next series of classes
takes place at Holy Cross Church, Tacoma, on
Sundays, February 20, March 13, and April 3.
