<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b> are from Charles Pellor
in memory of the Spallone, Meehan, and Pellor families.
<i>Floral offerings are a wonderful way to remember a deceased loved one, 
celebrate an anniversary, or give thanks for a prayer that has been answered. If 
you have been inspired to give thanks with flowers, please contact

<p><b>LEARNING THE NEW LANGUAGE OF THE MASS</b>. After
ALL Masses this weekend and next weekend, we will be
offering a short (45-minute) session to prepare for the
new Roman Missal. Many of our most familiar responses
at Mass will be changing. This will be our primary
opportunity to learn more and experience the responses
before we begin using the new language at Mass on
November 26-27. All Cathedral parishioners and regulars
are strongly encouraged to participate in one of these
sessions. Evening sessions will be held in the Cathedral
Chapel. Morning sessions will be held in the Holy
Names Room of the Pastoral Outreach Center.

<p><b>HOW SWEET IT IS: NEWS FROM THE CATHEDRAL
KITCHEN</b>. What do you do with 1,000 pounds of
candy? On Tuesday evenings, Matt Secrest, a sixth
grade teacher at Holy Rosary School in West Seattle,
comes to Cathedral Kitchen to volunteer his
dishwashing expertise. A couple of weeks ago he
asked if we would be interested in receiving Halloween
candy that the students would donate after Trick or
Treating. We said “Great”—thinking that he would be
bringing a couple of bags and that we could use the
candy in our lunch bags as an extra sweet. Much to our
surprise, we received bags and boxes of candy and
more candy. Matt said that it all weighed in at over
1,000 pounds—a blessing, to say the least! We have
been able to include the candy not only in our lunch
bags and on our dessert trays, but also have shared
these treats with the Winter Shelter, the Cathedral
Youth Music Program, Children’s Faith Formation, the
Frederic Ozanam House, Chancery Place, and St.
Mary’s Food Bank. Thank you to all the students at
Holy Rosary School for their partnership in sharing.</p>
<p><b>NEW IN THE BOOKSTORE</b>. Father James Martin, SJ’s
new book, <i>Between Heaven and Mirth: Laughing with
the Saints</i> is now in stock. Also, candles for your
Advent wreath!</p>
<p><b>EMMAUS COMPANIONS</b> are parishioners who are
available during the weekend Masses and coffee hours
to assist people who have come to the Cathedral in
crisis or with special needs. We are looking for a few
new people to join us in this important ministry of
welcoming and presence. All that is needed is a
listening ear and an open heart. Training and
mentoring are provided. <i>Information</i>,
