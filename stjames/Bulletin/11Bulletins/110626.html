<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James is
proud to welcome visitors from near and far
throughout the summer months. Each week a
drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from
among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your
address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and
drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your
presence in our midst today. <b>Last week, we had visitors
from Parker, AZ; Sutherland Springs, TX; Dayton,
OH, and many other places! The winner of our
drawing was from Flourtown, PA</b>.</i></p>
<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>. Flowers at the altar are
in loving memory of Joy Allan on the first anniversary of
her death, from Peggy, Elizabeth, Anna, and Matthew Behnken. Flowers at the Shrine of the Blessed Virgin
Mary in the north transept are from Jess and Elizabeth
Hernandez in memory of Linda Condes on the second
anniversary of her death. Flowers in the Cathedral are
also from the Saturday weddings of Sonali Roy and
Aaron Son, and Heidi Rise and Gerald Macheso.</p>
<p><b>PETER’S PENCE COLLECTION</b>. This weekend we take up
our annual collection to support the works and ministries
of the Holy Father, Benedict XVI.</p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b> is up and running!
Your friendly Cathedral baristas will be serving espresso
drinks after the 10:00 Mass. During the month of June,
all proceeds will go towards scholarships for the Schola
Cantorum Choir Camp. Try our special drink of the
month: the Jubi-latte! Please note that the espresso cart
will be closed during the months of July and August.</p>
<p><b>SUMMER TOURS</b>. During the summer months, June, July,
and August, we offer a tour of the Cathedral each
Wednesday at 1:00pm. This is a great opportunity to
share your Cathedral with out-of-town guests. No
reservations are necessary; gather in the west vestibule.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight, and
the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect way
to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>YOUTH MIGRANT PROJECT MISSION TRIP 2011</b>. It is not too late for high 
school students to sign up for a week of service and fun as we work with migrant 
workers and their families. Opportunities include working with children in the

7:00pm to watch this critically acclaimed film. It

and lemonade will be provided and you are welcome to
