from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here

<p><b>ARE YOU A CATHOLIC WHO HAS BEEN AWAY FROM
THE CHURCH?</b> Our Welcome Back program provides
a safe place, in the company of others who are also
examining their faith, to ask questions about returning
to regular church attendance, to the sacraments, and to
learn about changes in the church. The sessions are
offered on Mondays, January 3 through April 4, 7:00-9:00pm on 2nd floor Cathedral Place. Classes are
offered without any obligation. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH?</b> You are invited to
participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the
Catholic community of faith. It is a process which
encompasses the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching,
and Christian values—the development and deepening
of a life of prayer and action—all with the support and
involvement of the parish community. A new inquiry
session will begin on Wednesday, January 12.

<p><b>FINDING HOPE IN A TOPSY-TURVY JOB MARKET:
PRINCIPLES AND TOOLS TO JUMP START YOUR JOB
SEARCH</b>.
Beginning in January, a two-part series of classes will be
offered during the coming year that will incorporate
efforts to search for a job within a context of faith and
hope. Part one, which will take place on the first
Tuesday evening of each month, will focus on the
principles and tools needed for effective job searching,
including resume writing, interviewing techniques and
networking. Part two, which will take place on the third
Sunday morning of each month (following the 10:00 am
Mass), will focus on the application of concepts learned
in part one, including sharing strategies and struggles
with real life experiences of looking for a job. Sessions
will be facilitated by parishioners who are professionals
in this field. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>TO HUNGER FOR GOD</b>. Join us on Thursday, January 27

published book, <i>A Christian Understanding of Human
Nature: To Hunger For God</i>, describing the relationship
between God and the human person. He will also be

a dynamic speaker who can translate spiritual and
theological ideas into meaningful and practical concepts
for our own faith lives. Suggested donation: $10.

<p><b>ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A WAY TO HELP OTHERS AS
A NEW YEAR BEGINS WHILE ALSO LEARNING MORE
ABOUT YOUR CATHOLIC FAITH?</b> Consider being a
sponsor for one of our many new inquirers coming to
participate in our Christian Initiation process to learn
more about the Catholic Church (RCIA). We need St.
James parishioners to be companions with our new
inquirers to help welcome them to our community. All
training and support will be provided and the time
commitment is reasonable-a minimum of 2 sessions a
month (Wednesday evenings). To learn more, come to
our Sponsor Information meeting on Wednesday,
January 12 from 7:00-9:00 pm at Cathedral Place,
second floor. The rewards are many, including
renewal and update of your faith and “kudos” in
heaven. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. <i>Please note that babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses</i>.</p>

<p>We are the cathedral for the
Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle
and its Archbishop, The Most
Reverend J. Peter Sartain. We
are also a parish church for a
vibrant faith community with a
long history that reaches back to
Seattle’s early days.</p>
<p>We are an inner-city parish
with an outreach to many who live on the edge of
poverty and loneliness. We are a diverse
community that welcomes, accepts, and celebrates
the differences we all bring. We exist in the heart
of the city, yet sometimes our parishioners come
from considerable distances to worship here.</p>
<p>St. James Cathedral is a crossroads where ideas
and challenges both old and new are explored in
the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Our cathedral is also the center for many
cultural and ecumenical events which both reflect
and help to shape the fabric of a vital metropolitan
community.</p>
<p>Above all, St. James Cathedral is a community
of prayer.</p>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we

in Duvall; Holy Family in Auburn, Kirkland, and Seattle;
