<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

<p align="center"><font face="Papyrus" size="5">JOURNEY OF THE ELECT</font></p>
<p>This weekend we celebrate the first of the three
Scrutinies with the retelling of the story of the
Samaritan woman at the well. This Gospel
challenges our Elect to be honest about their
personal lives just as the woman was with her
encounter with Christ. In acknowledging their
sinfulness and need for healing, they come to
know more fully the mercy and loving acceptance
of Christ in their lives. To prepare for their
Scrutiny, each is asked to reflect upon what he/
she most thirst for in life, and then to bring that to
this ancient rite for God’s grace. Continue to enter
into these solemn rites in prayer with our Elect as
they prepare for baptism.</p>
<p><b>IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO BE A LENTEN PRAYER
PARTNER FOR ONE OF THE ELECT!</b> Prayer cards are available at the place of 
prayer located in the north aisle of the west nave of the Cathedral (where you 
can also learn more about each of them in our Book of the Elect), in the 
bookstore, and in Cathedral Hall during Sunday morning hospitality. You can also meet our
Elect on our <a href="../../Events/2011/bookoftheelect.htm">parish website</a>. Your prayers make a difference!!! <i>Information</i>
