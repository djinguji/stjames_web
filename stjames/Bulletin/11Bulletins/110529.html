<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

<p><b>SUMMER FILM FESTIVAL</b>. Join us Tuesday, June 14 for

Voices</i>—it is an inspirational coming-of-age story of
screenwriter Oscar Torres, who, as an 11 year-old boy,
was caught up in the El Salvador’s civil war. His saga
is harrowing and intensely moving. The movie is
principally about the effects of war on children (in
Spanish with subtitles—rated R). Popcorn and
lemonade will be provided and you are welcome to
bring your favorite movie treats. <i>Information</i>,
