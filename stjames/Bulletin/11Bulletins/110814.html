James thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During July, we were extremely
busy. We made 69 visits to our low income neighbors,
focusing primarily on preventing homelessness. Your

individuals in their homes! In addition, we helped 8
households avoid the shut off of their utilities, gave out
32 vouchers for food, and provided 35 St. Vincent de
Paul Thrift Store vouchers for clothes, housewares,
beds and other furniture. Members of the St. Vincent de
Paul Society follow Jesus through service to those in
need. Bearing witness to Christ’s compassionate and
liberating love, we show our commitment through
person-to-person contact. We always make our home
visits in pairs. As calls for help increase, we actively
seek new members. Please consider joining this deeply
rewarding ministry to the poor among us. <i>Information</i>,
