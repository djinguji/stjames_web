<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS IN THE CATHEDRAL</b> are from the Laughlin
family in thanksgiving for fifteen years in the
Cathedral parish.</p>
<p><b>LEARNING THE NEW LANGUAGE OF THE MASS</b>. After
ALL Masses this weekend, we will be
offering a short (45-minute) session to prepare for the
new Roman Missal. Many of our most familiar responses
at Mass will be changing. This will be our primary
opportunity to learn more and experience the responses
before we begin using the new language at Mass next weekend,
November 26-27. All Cathedral parishioners and regulars
are strongly encouraged to participate in one of these
sessions. Evening sessions will be held in the Cathedral
Chapel. Morning sessions will be held in the Holy
Names Room of the Pastoral Outreach Center.

<p><b>ANNOUNCING! MENTAL HEALTH MINISTRY: PRAYER
PARTNERS</b>. <i>Don’t be anxious about anything, but in
everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving,
present your requests to God</i> (<i>Phil 4:6</i>). We are a
branch of the Mental Health Ministry devoted to
praying for those living with mental illness and
emotional distress – either in themselves, a loved one,
or someone they care for. We help support the Mental
Health Ministry by responding to special requests and
needs that sometimes can only be answered with
prayers. We intercede for them in the name of Jesus,
confident that God will grant them the healing and
grace they need. If you would like to request prayers
for yourself, a loved one, or someone you care for, go to the
<a href="../../Education/mentalhealth.htm">Mental Health Ministry</a> page and submit your
prayer requests. All requests are strictly confidential.</p>
