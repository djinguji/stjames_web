<p dir="ltr"><b>THE DREAM ACT</b>. Thousands of hard working young
people who were brought to the United States as infants
or children can be deported to a country they have
never known. The DREAM Act would stop this
injustice to those who have grown up and graduated
high school in the United States, and would give them
the opportunity to serve our country and earn legal
status through higher education or military service.
Learn more about why the USCCB supports the Dream
Act by visiting the
