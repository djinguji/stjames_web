<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>DISASTER IN JAPAN</b>. A place of prayer has been
established in the Cathedral’s south aisle for the people of

than $9,000 was donated toward the relief effort. If you
would like to make a donation, please make your check
payable to Catholic Relief Services and write “Japan” in
the memo line. You can also make a 
<a class="navy" target="_bulletin" href="http://www.crs.org/japan/">donation online</a>.</p>

<p align="center"><font face="Papyrus" size="5">JOURNEY OF THE ELECT</font></p>
<p>Lent is a particularly special time for the Elect who
have been journeying towards baptism, Eucharist
and confirmation at the Easter Vigil. As part of their
preparation, the Church celebrates anointing with
the oil of the Catechumen, blessings and exorcisms.
Beginning next Sunday, we will join in prayer for
our Elect as they participate in the ancient
ceremonies called the Scrutinies that symbolize the
spiritual purification taking place in their lives as
they prepare for baptism. Through these Scrutinies,
blessings and anointings, the Elect are encouraged to
reflect more deeply on their own spiritual challenges
and weaknesses. At the same time, these rites offer
powerful prayers of faith, hope and strength on their
behalf, calling upon God’s grace and mercy to
penetrate their entire lives. Please continue to keep
them in your prayers.</p>
<p><b>LENTEN PRAYER PARTNERS FOR THE ELECT</b>. The
Church tells us that it is the <i>entire</i> parish’s
responsibility to support and welcome those
preparing for baptism this Easter. One of the many
ways you can do this is to become a prayer partner
for one of our Elect. You are asked to pray
everyday for him/her during Lent, asking for God’s
blessings and guidance. Also, notes and cards will
be collected during Holy Week to be given to the
Elect before Easter. Prayer cards are available at the
place of prayer located in the north aisle of the west
nave of the Cathedral (where you can also learn
more about each of them in our Book of the Elect),
in the bookstore, and in Cathedral Hall during
Sunday morning hospitality. You can also meet our
Elect on our <a href="../../Events/2011/bookoftheelect.htm">parish website</a>. Your prayers make a difference!!! <i>Information</i>
