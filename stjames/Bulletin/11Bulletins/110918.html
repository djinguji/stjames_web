<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I have some important news relating to our cathedral staff. When I first
began thinking about how I was going to tell you this, I had a pretty heavy heart,
but that is no longer true, thank God!</p>
<p>Helen Oesterle, our Director of RCIA and Adult Faith Formation, has
been offered the position of Pastoral Associate at Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish
in West Seattle and she has accepted. It’s a wonderful opportunity for her
because it is close to home for her and almost across the street from Mount St.
Vincent’s where her Dad is living. It’s hard not to see the hand of God at work
in this.</p>
<p>It’s equally hard not to see the hand of God at work in the second part of
what I have to share with you. I have asked TerryAnn Bowen who for the past
five years has ably led our Welcome Back program, children’s RCIA, and
confirmation program, to step into Helen’s shoes and she has happily and very
enthusiastically agreed.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it will be very difficult to let Helen go after all her years
with us! She has done an amazing job and touched more lives than any of us can
count. She has not only directed our RCIA and adult faith formation programs,
she has prepared hundreds of families for the celebration of the sacrament of
baptism and the sacrament of matrimony. She has led Bible Study, Catholic 101,
our Summer Film Festival—and so much more. And her energy and enthusiasm
for her ministry have been contagious. In fact, I think it’s safe to say that each
one of us has ‘caught’ Helen’s ‘fever’ and is the better for it! It won’t be at all
easy to see her go. At the same time, I am very happy that this opportunity has
come her way because it seems the right fit at the right time.</p>
<p>For now, please join me in thanking God for opening up a wonderful new
possibility for Helen and for sending TerryAnn to us. Later this fall, we’ll have a
chance to celebrate Helen’s ministry and to thank her for her service.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

extraordinary response to the Wednesday tours of the
Cathedral we’ve offered all summer, that we will
continue to offer tours of the Cathedral each
Wednesday at 1:00pm throughout the year. This is a
great way to share the Cathedral with family and
guests.</p>

Formation sessions will begin on September 25. We strongly encourage you to

envelopes, or are on the direct debit program, we will
mail you a quarterly report of your contributions to the
parish. Registration cards can be found in the vestibule.
<i>If you are not sure whether or not you’re registered,

<p><b>HELP FEED THE HUNGRY</b>. Operation Nightwatch is an
ecumenical Christian ministry providing hot meals and
shelter referrals to 150-200 homeless people every
night. St. James parishioners cook and serve dinner at
the Nightwatch Center three times a month. We need
food donors for the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays. Items we
could use include the following: frozen meat for the
main meal, sandwich meats, sliced cheese, bread,
condiment packets. Leave your donations marked
Operation Nightwatch in the Cathedral Hall kitchen after Masses on Sunday, or 
deliver them to the Parish Office before 4:00 pm on the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>YOUTH MUSIC OPPORTUNITIES</b>. Our famous Youth
Music Program has openings in all four choirs. The
mission of the Cathedral’s youth music is to develop
full, active and conscious participation in the liturgy
through singing. Our teachers are some of the region’s
best music teachers and know how to inspire children.
<i>Information</i>
<a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/music">Cathedral 
Music</a> website or 206-382-4874.</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We welcome
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children. Many families find that sitting in the front
rows, where the view is unobstructed, allows children
to participate more fully. Others are more comfortable
sitting at the ends of the aisles, so that they can easily
step into the west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if
their child needs a quiet place away from the assembly.
We have provided a sound system in these areas so you
can continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. For those who wish, babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Matthew in
Seattle, SS. Cosmas and Damian in Orting, and St. Vincent
de Paul in Federal Way.</p>
