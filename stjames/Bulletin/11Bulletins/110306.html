<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>If you’re anything like me, you’re a bit
disoriented by the extreme lateness of Lent’s
arrival this year. It almost seems like we should
be getting out the palms and lilies but, no, we
haven’t yet gotten to the ashes!</p>
<p>Late or early, however, Lent is always a six
-week journey and the truth is that we need that
much time to really get into it. At least I do.
We also need some guidance for the journey
and the Church is happy to offer not only
guidance but a rich and powerful – and time-tested
regimen. It comprises three parts. Allow
me to walk you through each of them.</p>
<p>Part one is <b>PRAYER</b>. The most important
prayer we have is, of course, the Sunday Mass
we celebrate here together in the Cathedral. If
we were to do nothing more this Lent than to
participate more fully, actively, and consciously
in each of the Lenten Sunday celebrations, we
would be doing something great. The Sundays
of Lent are rich in opportunities for growth in
faith and in the understanding of our faith. But
we needn’t stop there. Lenten weekday Masses
are also a wonderful way for deepening our
walk with Christ during this holy season. And
here are even some more possibilities:
extending your family prayer at meal times,
taking some time each day to read and reflect
prayerfully on the Gospels (this could be a
family thing, too); attending Vespers and
Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament on
Sunday afternoons; joining the Friday evening
Taizé Prayer around the Cross; praying the
Stations of the Cross on Mondays, Wednesdays,
or Fridays; or joining in the Lenten Holy Hour
on Friday afternoons.</p>
<p>Still one other wonderful opportunity for
prayer this Lent is the “adoption” of one of our
“Elect” (the people who will be baptized and
confirmed and receive the Eucharist for the first
time at the Easter Vigil). “Adoption” means
that you will take it on yourself to pray for that
person in a special way all during Lent. Prayer
cards will be available in the north aisle of the
Cathedral and in the parish hall during the first
few weeks of Lent, each one with the name of
one of our Elect. If you take a card, (and I really
hope you do), in addition to your prayer, you
will be invited close to Easter time to write a
card or short note telling your “adopted” friend
of your prayerful support. This can be a
wonderful and very ‘hands-on’ way of reaching
out to our newest members, supporting them
along their journey of faith. And it’s something
EVERYONE can do!</p>
<p>Part two of the Lenten regimen is
<b>FASTING</b>. The church is wise in reminding us
that fasting can help put us in closer contact
with Jesus who willingly accepted suffering and
even death in order to show us the depth of his
love for us. What better way to draw close to
Jesus than by freely denying ourselves some of
life’s comforts? And what better way to draw
close to the suffering people of the world—the
hungry, the homeless, the hopeless—than by
tasting, even in a small way, their cup of
suffering?</p>
<p>Part three is <b>ALMSGIVING</b>. I like to
connect this with fasting. Fasting can be no
more than proudly flexing one’s spiritual
muscles—the spiritual equivalent of strutting
about the gym—if it is not related to reaching
out to others. And again this year the Church
offers you the perfect way to do just that. The
Rice Bowl Program is the perfect vehicle for
turning fasting into a work of Christian love.
Think what will happen this Lent if you make
the Rice Bowl your table centerpiece and then
put into it each day or each week the money
you have saved by eating a little more simply
than usual. On Holy Thursday, when we invite
all of you to bring forward your Rice Bowls at
the collection time of the Mass, you will see in a
powerful way how people who take Lent
seriously can make a difference not only in their
lives but in the lives of hungry people in our
world.</p>
<p>It was at our baptism that we got our
Christian “passport,” and it is our baptism that
calls us to walk the Lenten journey with Jesus.
May we walk the journey together in faith,
hope, and love!</p>
