<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

<p><b>TOURS OF THE CATHEDRAL</b>. We’ve had such an extraordinary response to 
the Wednesday tours of the Cathedral we’ve offered all summer, that we will 
continue to offer tours of the Cathedral each Wednesday at 1:00pm throughout the 
year. This is a great way to share the Cathedral with family and guests.</p>

THE CHURCH?</b> It is not too late to join our Welcome Back program – a safe
