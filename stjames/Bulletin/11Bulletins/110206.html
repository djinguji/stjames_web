in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

<p><b>HELP A NEIGHBOR IN NEED</b>. Many people in our

Volunteer Chore Services, you can help someone stay
in his or her own home, avoiding the need to move to
an institutional setting. To learn more about VCS, plan
to attend a brief information session on Sunday,
February 20 from 11:15 to 11:45am in the Mother
Mary Rose Room of the Pastoral Outreach Center
