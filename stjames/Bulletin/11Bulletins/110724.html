<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Happy Feast Day! As I write this, early in the week and only too aware of
how iffy our weather has been, I find myself wondering what kind of a day
we’re going to get for our patronal feast day and parish picnic. Hope springs
eternal, and we do have history on our side. Not once in all my years here have
we been rained out on St. James Day. May our record continue! </p>
<p>I have phenomenally good news to share with you. We have gone over
our goal for this year’s Annual Catholic Appeal. When I say “goal,” I’m
referring to our combined Archdiocesan and parish goals. The Archdiocese
asked us to raise $310,000 and we set an additional goal of $175,000 in order to
support the great work of the Cathedral Kitchen. As of this week, we have more
than met that combined goal. The last figure we received from the archdiocese is
$519,000! Those are the numbers. The real story is the sacrifice so many of you
made in order to make this possible; the real story is the generous response of
just over 900 of our parish households. Admittedly, this represents only about
40 percent of our registered parishioners but, even so, it is a remarkable
achievement and one that far exceeds that of any other parish in the archdiocese.
I wish I could thank each of you personally for your amazing response but
there’s no way I can. But I do trust that you know how truly grateful I am – and
how proud I am to be your pastor. </p>
<p>Enjoy St. James day, rain or shine, and together, let us commit ourselves
to following together in the steps of our great patron, St. James the Apostle, who
is our constant companion on the great pilgrimage of life and faith. </p>

working in the fields that grow produce for a local food
bank, and hosting a fiesta for the migrant families. In
