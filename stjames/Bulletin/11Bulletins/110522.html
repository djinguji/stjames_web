<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Back in 1981, my predecessor as pastor, Father William Gallagher, had the
wisdom and enlightened good sense to hire Dr. James Savage as the Cathedral’s
music director. His decision turned out to be a profoundly important one. We are
still experiencing its effects today.</p>
<p>When Jim arrived here, the Cathedral was, in many respects, a far different
place than it is today. It looked very different (on the inside!), and the parish that
gathered here was very different: only about a third of the size it now is and made
up mostly of people living in the neighborhood. Children were hard to find. One of
the only constants throughout those 30 years has been Jim Savage himself!</p>
<p>Thirty years is a long time. It’s nearly a third of the Cathedral’s history. It’s
also time enough to create a legacy, and Jim has surely done that. Thanks to his
leadership, the music program of St. James Cathedral has come to be recognized
throughout this country as both superior and superb. And when I say that I include
the entire music program, all of it world class: the organists, the Cathedral Choir of
St. James, the Women of St. James Schola, the Cathedral Cantorei, the Cathedral
Chamber Orchestra, and the Cathedral’s three children’s choirs (Schola Cantorum,
St. Gregory Choir, St. Cecilia Singers). When Jim arrived on the scene, there was an
organist and a rather small choir — a music program at a fairly low ebb even though
there had been some high points in its history.</p>
<p>But it’s not just the music program that has changed over these years. The
Cathedral building itself has changed and Jim played an important role in all those
changes, serving as my trusted advisor on nearly every artistic and liturgical
judgment that was made during the great renovation and restoration of 1994. In the
Catholic Church, liturgy and music and the arts are not separate entities: they are
intricately and inseparably woven together in the great fabric that is Catholic
worship. With his considerable gifts, Jim was very instrumental in making sure that
each of those essential elements played its proper part in that great undertaking.</p>
<p>Thirty years is a long time, but the mere passage of time is no guarantee of
progress, growth, or success. In Jim’s case, however, 30 years has meant the growth
of something truly wonderful and the blossoming of something beyond beautiful.
Sunday after Sunday when we come together, each of us is a part of that beautiful
something as we sing together the praises of our God in our magnificent Cathedral.
And as we do – and especially so on Jim’s thirtieth anniversary weekend – I hope
we will stop to give thanks to God for sending Jim Savage to St. James, thanks, too,
to Jim for using his amazing gifts to help St. James become the wonderful praying,
singing, and serving community it is!</p>

morning. There will be a table there where you can write a note of appreciation.</p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from Ned Flohr and
family, in loving memory of Nancy Flohr on the third
anniversary of her death. <i>Floral offerings are a wonderful way to remember a 
deceased loved one, celebrate an anniversary, or give thanks for a prayer that 
has been answered. If you have been inspired to give thanks with flowers, please

<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b> is up and running!
Your friendly Cathedral baristas will be serving espresso
drinks after the 10:00 Mass. In honor of Mary and all
the St. James mothers, the proceeds from the espresso
cart will go to the Babysitting Program for the month of
May.</p>
<p><b>APPEAR AND INSPIRE</b>. May 21 and 22, 8:00
pm Seattle Pro Musica, a Cathedral Resident
Ensemble, Karen P. Thomas, conductor. Britten's
evocative paean to the patron saint of music—the
Hymn to St. Cecilia—provides the inspiration for this
concert. Also, Joseph Rheinberger’s romantic <i>Mass in Eb for Double Choir</i>, Ralph Vaughan Williams’ 
<i>Five
Mystical Songs</i>, and John Rutter’s dazzling <i>Hymn to
the Creator of Light</i>. <i>Information</i>, 206-781-2766 or

<p><b>FAREWELL, BISHOP TYSON</b>. Pope Benedict XVI has
appointed our own auxiliary bishop, Joseph Tyson, as
Bishop of Yakima. All are invited to pray with Bishop
Tyson and give thanks for his ministry among us at a
special Mass of thanksgiving on Friday, May 27 at
5:30pm.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight,
and the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé
in France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect
way to end a busy week. <i>Please note: on Friday, May
27, the prayer will take place in the Pastoral Outreach
Center, Holy Names Room</i>.</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. For those who wish, babysitting is available
in the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</p>
<p><b>SHARE SAFE HAVEN SHELTER</b>. We are pleased to
welcome back our friends from the SHARE Safe
Haven Shelter, who will once again be staying in
Cathedral Hall each night this summer. Safe Haven is
a self-governing group of approximately 25 homeless
men and women whom we have had the privilege of
hosting during previous summers when our Winter
Shelter program is not in operation, and we are happy
to have them with us again this year. Homelessness
does not take a “summer vacation” and neither should
our care and concern for our homeless brothers and
sisters. Please hold the members of the Safe Haven
Shelter in your prayers this summer.</p>
<p><b>DO YOU HAVE A CHILD WHO IS</b>: At least 7 years old
seeking Baptism in the Catholic Church? Or, at least 7

<p><b>SUMMER FILM FESTIVAL</b>. Join us Tuesday, June 14 for
the return of this popular summer series in Cathedral
Place, 2nd floor at 7:00pm. Our first film, cosponsored
by our ESL program, is entitled <i>Innocent
Voices</i>—it is an inspirational coming-of-age story of
screenwriter Oscar Torres, who, as an 11 year-old boy,
was caught up in the El Salvador’s civil war. His saga
is harrowing and intensely moving. The movie is
principally about the effects of war on children (in
Spanish with subtitles—rated R). Popcorn and
lemonade will be provided and you are welcome to
bring your favorite movie treats. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never
officially registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to

mailings from the Cathedral (including offering
envelopes!), are regular recipients of the Cathedral’s
quarterly journal <i>In Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate
their wedding at the Cathedral, and their children may
attend any of the five Catholic Rainbow Schools at
parishioner rates. In addition, if you are a registered
parishioner and use envelopes, or are on the direct
debit program, we will mail you a quarterly report of
your contributions to the parish. Registration cards can
be found in the vestibule. <i>If you are not sure whether
or not you’re registered, call the Parish Office, 206-622-3559</i>.</p>
<p><b>NEED PASTORAL CARE?</b> The Cathedral provides a

sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick, we can help!
