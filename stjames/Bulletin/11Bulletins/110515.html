<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

<p><b>BLESSING OF CATHEDRAL MENTAL HEALTH MINISTRY</b>.
Monday, May 16, 2011, at the 5:30pm Mass, we will
have a special blessing of our new mental health
ministry (see page in this week’s bulletin) and of all
volunteers and staff who work with the mentally ill. We
will be joined by members of the Order of Malta, who
have helped fund this new endeavor. All are welcome.</p>
<p><b>FAREWELL, BISHOP TYSON</b>. Pope Benedict XVI has
appointed our own auxiliary bishop, Joseph Tyson, as
Bishop of Yakima. All are invited to a special Mass of
thanksgiving on Friday, May 27 at 5:30pm, to pray
with Bishop Tyson and give thanks for his ministry
among us.</p>
<p><b>SHARE SAFE HAVEN SHELTER</b>. We are pleased to
welcome back our friends from the SHARE Safe
Haven Shelter, who will once again be staying in
Cathedral Hall each night this summer. Safe Haven is
a self-governing group of approximately 25 homeless
men and women whom we have had the privilege of
hosting during previous summers when our Winter
Shelter program is not in operation, and we are happy
to have them with us again this year. Homelessness
does not take a “summer vacation” and neither should
our care and concern for our homeless brothers and
sisters. Please hold the members of the Safe Haven
Shelter in your prayers this summer.</p>

<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. For those who wish, babysitting is available
in the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</p>
