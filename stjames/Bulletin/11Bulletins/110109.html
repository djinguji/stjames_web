<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b> is up and running!
Your friendly Cathedral baristas will be serving espresso
drinks after the 10:00 Mass. <i>During the month of
January, all proceeds will benefit the Cathedral’s
Youth Music Program</i>. If you are interested in becoming
a Cathedral barista, please call Sean and Katherine Berry
at 206-571-6868. Training is provided!</p>
<p><b>FOUNDATIONS IN FAITH SERIES—THE LETTERS OF ST.
PAUL</b>. This Sunday, January 9, 1:30-5:30 pm at St. Peter’s
Parish Hall in Beacon Hill. This Scripture class will look
at Paul’s cultural, religious and social background and
well as the story of his conversion and how it impacted his
ministry. Participants will review his missionary journeys
and the importance of his letters to the First Century
Christian communities and the issues he addressed with
them. This is a wonderful opportunity for an in-depth look
at Catholic teaching and its implications for our everyday
lives. Cost: $5 per class and new people always welcome.

<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH?</b> You are invited to
participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the
Catholic community of faith. It is a process which

and Christian values—the development and deepening
of a life of prayer and action—all with the support and
involvement of the parish community. A new inquiry
session will begin on Wednesday, January 12.

A NEW YEAR BEGINS WHILE ALSO LEARNING MORE
ABOUT YOUR CATHOLIC FAITH?</b> Consider being a
sponsor for one of our many new inquirers coming to
participate in our Christian Initiation process to learn
more about the Catholic Church (RCIA). We need St.
James parishioners to be companions with our new
inquirers to help welcome them to our community. All
training and support will be provided and the time
commitment is reasonable—a minimum of 2 sessions a
month (Wednesday evenings). To learn more, come to
our Sponsor Information meeting on Wednesday,
