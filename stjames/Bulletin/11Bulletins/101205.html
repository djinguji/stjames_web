<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

<p><b>YOUNG ADULTS “WARM HEARTS AND SOLES”</b> 7th annual Advent sock drive for 
homeless men continues today, Sunday, December 5. Your generosity is warming our 
hearts, but we still have a way to go to reach our goal of 2010 pairs for 
delivery in January to warm the soles of those in need. Let’s keep it up by 
dropping off new socks at the Young Adult table in Cathedral Hall after 8:00am, 
10:00am, and 12:00 Sunday Masses, or during the week at 2nd floor Cathedral 
Place. Such a worthwhile project – let’s keep those hearts and soles warm this 
winter! <i>Information</i>

<p><b>PARISH CHILDREN'S CHRISTMAS PARTY</b>. Saturday,
December 18, 11:30am—2:00pm, Cathedral Hall. It's
really for the whole family...Something you don't want
to miss. There will be a piñata, Christmas fish pond,
Santa Claus, and of course, food and fun! We will also
have a blessing of nativity sets. So if you have a small
family creche, bring it to the party to be blessed. Please
RSVP to Theresa (206-219-5822) by 4 pm, Wednesday,

<p><b>HELP A NEIGHBOR IN NEED</b>. Many people in our
community need help with transportation, shopping,
laundry, and housework. Advanced age, chronic illness
and financial difficulties can prevent our neighbors from
accomplishing these routine daily tasks. By volunteering
just a few hours a month with Volunteer Chore Services
(VCS), you can help someone stay in his or her own
home, avoiding the need to move to a nursing home or
other institutional setting. The next training for VCS
volunteers is scheduled for Wednesday, January 19 at
6:15pm in the Mother Mary Rose Room of the Pastoral
Outreach Center (907 Columbia). <i>Information</i>,
