<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James is
proud to welcome visitors from near and far
throughout the summer months. Each week a
drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from
among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your
address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and
drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your
presence in our midst today. <b>Last week, we had visitors
from Sewickly, PA; Bethesda, OH; Calgary, Canada,
and many other places! The winner of our drawing
was from Burbank, CA</b>.</i></p>
<p><b>ST. VINCENT DE PAUL COLLECTION</b>. This week as you
leave the Cathedral the ushers will take up our monthly
St. Vincent de Paul Collection for the poor and needy in
our downtown area. Thank you for your generosity.</p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b> is up and running!
Your friendly Cathedral baristas will be serving espresso
drinks after the 10:00 Mass. During the month of June,
all proceeds will go towards scholarships for the Schola
Cantorum Choir Camp. Try our special drink of the
month: the Jubi-latte!</p>
<p><b>SUMMER TOURS</b>. During the summer months, June, July,
and August, we offer a tour of the Cathedral each
Wednesday at 1:00pm. This is a great opportunity to
share your Cathedral with out-of-town guests. No
reservations are necessary; gather in the west vestibule.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight, and
the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect way
to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>YOUTH MIGRANT PROJECT MISSION TRIP 2011</b>. It is not too late for high 
school students to sign up for a week of service and fun as we work with migrant 
workers and their families. Opportunities include working with children in the 
daycare, and assisting at the food and clothing banks. Don’t miss out!! <i>

<p><b>COFFEE HOUR HOSPITALITY NEEDS YOU!</b> As we
move into the warmer summer weather, we will again
be offering hospitality “al fresco” in the Archbishop
Murphy courtyard following the Sunday morning
masses. But we need your help to make this happen!
We are looking for several outgoing people to help
with set-up, serving and clean-up for this very
important ministry of hospitality. We especially need
help following the 12:00 Mass. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>CONGRATULATIONS AND GOD’S
BLESSINGS</b>. Last weekend we celebrated the
Rite of Reception for Full Communion into
the Catholic Church with <i>Daniel Benoit</i>, <i>Jim
Bernhardt</i>, <i>Sarah Jones</i>, <i>Llewellyn Matthews</i>, <i>Erin
Morris</i>, <i>Gabriel Morris</i>, <i>Tuan Shelton</i>, and <i>Sarah Wiesner</i>. They made a Profession of Faith and
celebrated the sacraments of Eucharist and
Confirmation, and now join us as full
members of our Catholic Christian family.
We welcome them with great joy!</p>
<p><b>CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR FIVE
CANDIDATES</b> in RCIA Adapted for Older
Children who made their First Holy
Communion last Sunday at the Noon Mass:
<i>Bianca Cuellar</i>, <i>Kurt Gorospe</i>, <i>Daniel Kim</i>, <i>Mora

<p><b>CHOIR CAMP</b>. St. James Cathedral's Youth Music
Program is now registering students in grades 4-8
(treble voices) for our annual Choir Camp, August 15-21. This exciting week-long camp provides children
training in music fundamentals, Orff instruments, and
proper singing techniques; and fosters their active
participation in the liturgy through music. <i>For audition

<p><b>IS GOD CALLING YOU TO A MINISTRY AMONG
CHILDREN</b>, helping them to grow in their relationship
with Jesus? The wonderful children in our parish need
volunteers to help in Sunday school as catechists
(teachers), assistants, a third supportive adult presence
in class or as the welcoming presence at the doors.

<p><b>VOLUNTEERS NEEDED FOR HOSPITALITY</b>. Looking for
a “few good people” to assist in setting up, greeting
participants, and putting things away for our weekly RCIA gathering. The time commitment is once a
month from 6:00-9:30pm. It is a great way to meet
new people and support an important parish ministry.

<p><b>LISTENING ASSISTANCE DEVICES</b>. If you have trouble
hearing the spoken word in the Cathedral, ask an usher
about using one of our listening assistance devices,
which provide clear and clean sound. Not just for the
hard of hearing!</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND/OR BECOMING
CATHOLIC?</b> You are invited to participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the Catholic
community of faith. It is a process which encompasses
the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching, and Christian
values—the development and deepening of a life of
prayer and action—all with the support and
involvement of the parish community. You can learn
more by going to the <a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA">RCIA 
website</a>. A
new inquiry session will begin Wednesday, July 13 at
7:00 pm in Cathedral Place, second floor.

<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. For those who wish, babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</p>

<p>Thank you to all who turned in or mailed in your
pledge last week. <b>As you can see, WE STILL HAVE A
LONG WAY TO GO TO MEET OUR GOAL! The only way
we’ll be able to make it is if each one of us becomes
a part of this important appeal. At this point, all
pledges turned in will directly benefit our Cathedral
outreach ministries, in particular our Cathedral
Kitchen</b>. Please turn in your pledge TODAY and be a part of this important 
Appeal. You may make a onetime gift or spread your gift out over as many as ten 
months. Visit

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the

More in Lynnwood, and St. Aloysius in Buckley.</p>
