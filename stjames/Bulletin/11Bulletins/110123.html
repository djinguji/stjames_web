<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

way to remember a deceased loved one, celebrate an
anniversary, or give thanks for a prayer that has been
answered. If you have been inspired to give thanks with
flowers, please contact

<p><b>FOUNDATIONS IN FAITH SERIES—THE TRINITY</b>. TODAY, Sunday, January 23, 1:30-5:30 
pm at St. Peter’s Parish Hall in Beacon Hill. This class will discuss Jesus as 
the central reality of the Church’s faith and how the doctrine of the Trinity 
flows from that faith. We will explore our belief in the Trinity logically, 
historically and inspirationally while defining terms such as “theology,” 
“Incarnation,” and “economy of salvation.” A discussion of the relationship of 
our Triune God will lead to a deeper understanding of God’s relationship to us 
and ours to each Person of the Trinity. This is a wonderful opportunity for an in-depth look at 
Catholic teaching and its implications for our everyday lives. Cost: $5 per 
class and new people always welcome. (Co-sponsored by St. James Cathedral with 
the South Seattle Deanery) <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>CELEBRATING CATHOLIC SCHOOLS—THE RAINBOW
SCHOOLS COALITION</b>. On February 6 we will
celebrate Catholic School education, and in a
particular way the Cathedral children who attend one
of the five Rainbow Schools. Our parish is a
contributing member of the Rainbow Schools
Program whereby children from our parish can attend
at “parishioner” tuition rates. Approximately 60
cathedral children are enrolled in one of these fine
schools. Representatives of Sts. Edward, George,
Paul, Joseph and Therese Catholic Schools will be
available after the 10:00 and 12:00 Masses during
hospitality. Children attending the Rainbow Schools
and other Catholic Schools are encouraged to wear
their uniforms that day. In addition, our parish has
established the Cathedral Scholarship Fund to assist
families in meeting the financial obligation involved
in sending their elementary school aged children to
any one of the Rainbow Schools. <i>Information</i>,

Meeting Monday, Tuesday, February 8, 6:00 pm in
the Mother Mary Rose Room, Pastoral Outreach
Center. Our faith calls us to care for all of God’s
creation. Do you feel that call? Do you want to learn
more and get involved? Join the St. James
Environmental Justice Group to learn about
environmental activities at the parish, and to share
your own ideas. We will be planning our work for
2011, including Environmental Lobby Day and the

<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO CART</b> is up and
running! Your friendly Cathedral baristas will be
serving espresso drinks after the 10:00 Mass. <i>During
the month of January, all proceeds will benefit the
Cathedral’s Youth Music Program</i>. If you are
interested in becoming a Cathedral barista, please call
Sean and Katherine Berry at 206-571-6868. Training
is provided!</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. Please note that babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Paul in LaConner and Seattle, and St. Paul Mission in Westport.</p>
