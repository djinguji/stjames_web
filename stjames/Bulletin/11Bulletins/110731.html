<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James is
proud to welcome visitors from near and far
throughout the summer months. Each week a
drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from
among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your
address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and
drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your
presence in our midst today. <b>Last week, we had visitors
from Highlands Ranch, CO; Coquitlam, B.C.; 
Algueirao, Portugal, and many other places!  The winner 
of our drawing was from Champlin, MN</b>.</i></p>
<p><b>SUMMER TOURS</b>. During the summer months, June, July,
and August, we offer a tour of the Cathedral each
Wednesday at 1:00pm. This is a great opportunity to
share your Cathedral with out-of-town guests. No
reservations are necessary; gather in the west vestibule.</p>

<p><b>DISASTER PREPAREDNESS</b> information and handouts
from the American Red Cross will be available at the
coffee hours after today’s Masses. Only 7% of
Americans have taken the recommended actions to
prepare for disasters. If you’re in the remaining 93%,
the American Red Cross urges you to make a plan and
create a disaster supplies kit. Your family will cope
best by preparing for earthquakes, floods or winter
storms before they strike. Sponsored by the Health and
Healing Ministry.</p>

Catholic Social Teaching, the church’s “best kept

hours to assist people who have come to the

<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. For those who wish, babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</p>
<p><b>NEED PASTORAL CARE?</b> Whether you are sick or
homebound and in need of communion, or would like a
CD of Sunday’s Mass, or need the sacrament of the
Anointing of the Sick, we can help! <i>Information</i>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Olaf in
Poulsbo, St. Alphonsus in Seattle, and St. John Vianney in
Kirkland, Vashon, and Darrington.</p>
