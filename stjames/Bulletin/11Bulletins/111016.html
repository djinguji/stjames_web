the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

finding a job and permanent housing. Join members of

<p><b>THE ST. VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During September, we made 67
home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions saved 36 individuals and families from
being evicted and prevented 6 utility shut offs. We
provided food to 44 households. In addition, we
supplied 22 St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Store vouchers
for beds, furniture, housewares and clothes, and we
helped one person replace stolen ID. Members of the
St. Vincent de Paul Society follow Jesus through
service to those in need. Bearing witness to Christ’s
compassionate and liberating love, we show our
commitment through person-to-person contact, making
our home visits in pairs. As calls for assistance
increase, we actively seek new members. Please
consider joining this deeply rewarding ministry to the
poor among us. <i>Information</i>, Rob Millar 206-954-8902
