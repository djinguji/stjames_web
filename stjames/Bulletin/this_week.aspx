<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>RESPONDING TO THE THREAT OF THE CORONAVIRUS</b>.
In response to the outbreak of Coronavirus in King
County, Archbishop Etienne has asked all Catholics in
the Archdiocese to observe the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you are sick or feel you are getting sick, stay at
home and do NOT attend Mass. Missing Mass due
to illness is not sinful; it is prudent and shows care
for your brothers and sisters.</li>
<li>Please note that the CDC encourages older adults
(60+) and those with chronic illnesses to stay at
home as much as possible.</li>
	<li>During Mass, at the Sign of Peace, simply say,
“Peace be with you,” instead of offering your hand.</li>
<li>During Communion, the Eucharist will only be
offered in the hand, not on the tongue. Additionally,
we will refrain from offering the Precious Blood
from the chalice at this time.</li>
	<li>You will notice that we have drained the holy water
in the church, until further notice. Please simply
bless yourself with the sign of the cross as you enter
and exit the church.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>EVENT CANCELLATIONS/POSTPONEMENTS</b>. The
following events have been canceled in observance of
recommendations about limiting non-essential
gatherings:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Youth Confirmation Retreat 3/14-15</li>
<li>Youth Music Program through 3/23</li>
	<li>Youth Ministry activities through 3/23</li>
<li>New Heart, New Spirit Lenten Series, 3/16, 3/23</li>
	<li>Matt Talbot St. Patrick’s Day Dinner, 3/15</li>
<li>Ecology Fair, 3/29</li>
	<li>Choir of St. John’s College, Cambridge, 3/29</li>
</ul>
<p>Please check the Cathedral website for up-to-date
information about events at the Cathedral, as the
situation is changing from day to day!</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL BLOOD DRIVE WEDNESDAY MARCH 18</b>.
Sign up at Coffee Hours after Masses or call Bloodworks NW, 800-398-7888, ext. 1 (mention St.
James). The Pacific Northwest’s blood supply is at risk
of collapse in coming days. The accelerating number of
blood drive cancellations due to the closure of schools,
businesses, and events over coronavirus concerns has
put nearly 60% of the community’s blood supply in
jeopardy. Without available blood, doctors will have to
make life or death decisions about who receives blood
and who doesn’t. Donors are needed to prevent a threat
to our area’s blood supply. Donating blood is a safe
activity. Individuals are not at risk of contracting
coronavirus through the blood donation process.
Bloodworks policies comply with FDA, CDC, local
health departments, and other recommendations related
to COVID-19. Bloodworks routinely sanitizes donation
areas, chairs, surfaces and common objects like door
knobs and light switches, and uses hand sanitizer.
Staff, donors, and volunteers are encouraged to stay
home if they feel unwell. It takes 1,000 blood donors
every day to keep our community’s blood supply at
stable levels. Bloodworks has posted information
addressing questions and concerns for blood donors at
<a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.bloodworksnw.org/coronavirus">www.bloodworksnw.org/coronavirus</a>.</p>

Lent. As Easter draws near, you will be invited to write
a note telling our Elect of your prayerful support.</p>
<p><b>WAY OF THE CROSS FOR REFUGEES AND
IMMIGRANTS</b>. The Stations of the Cross are a useful reminder to remember not 
only the passion of Jesus, but also how the Way of the Cross continues today in 
those who are oppressed and crucified, including refugees and immigrants. Join 
St. James Immigrant Assistance on Wednesday, March 25, for the Way of the Cross 
in support of refugees and immigrants, at St. James Cathedral. Stations will

<p><b>REMEMBERING ST. OSCAR ROMERO</b>. This year marks
the 40th anniversary of the martyrdom of St. Oscar
Romero, the heroic Archbishop of El Salvador who
was canonized by Pope Francis in 2018. All are invited
to honor him at a special Archdiocesan celebration on
Saturday, March 21 at 10:00am. After Mass, there will
be an opportunity to attend a short presentation on the
life and witness of the new saint. Saint Oscar Romero,
pray for us!</p>
<p><b>CRS RICE BOWL: MEET YVONE</b>. Yvone is from Kenya.
She learned proper nutrition and hygiene practices to
help keep her healthy and in school. Yvone now has a
chance to dream and the strength to follow those
dreams. How can you ensure that young people in your
community receive proper nutrition? Visit

<p><b>CARE FOR CREATION TIP</b>. Are you experiencing
anxiety, stress, or feelings of hopelessness about our
changing environment and planet? Take action in a
meaningful way and join a team that is making positive
change, not climate change. St. James’ Care for
Creation Committee is working on the Earth Day 2020
Covenant, a promise to move our community towards
sustainability for ourselves and the planet. We base our
work on the principles of <i>Laudato Si'</i>, Pope Francis'
environmental encyclical which calls all of us to
conversion and action. Come join us on the first
Wednesday of the month at 6:30pm, in the Pastoral
Outreach Center.</p>
<p><b>CENSUS 2020–BE COUNTED!</b> Every 10 years the
results of the census are used to reapportion the House
of Representatives, determining how many seats each
state gets. They also redraw the boundaries of the
congressional and state legislative districts to account
for population shifts. A full, accurate count lays the
foundation for a healthy democracy and communities
where families thrive and flourish. Be counted and
make sure you are well represented. Look for your
invitation to respond to the census on or between
March 12 and 20. New this year is an online form.
Your invitation postcard will have the code you need to
fill out the form.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we pray for the parishes of St. Joseph in Chehalis,
Vancouver, Pe Ell, Ferndale, Issaquah, Elma, and Sequim.</p>
