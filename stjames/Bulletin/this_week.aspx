<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>You may remember that in launching this Year of Mercy, Pope Francis challenged
us with these words: “In this Jubilee Year, let us allow God to surprise us.”</p>
<p>That got me to thinking. Are we open as a parish to God’s surprises? Am I open as
pastor to God’s surprises? To help answer this, I decided to do two things. The first was
to conduct a survey of the entire parish last fall to learn what your hopes, dreams, and
concerns were. More than 600 of you participated and the results were shared with you in
the bulletin and in our parish journal, <i>In Your Midst</i>. Secondly, I convened a new Vision
Council for the parish. I wanted to explore how a representative group of engaged
parishioners—people like you—were experiencing the life of this Cathedral community.
Where did we need to grow and change? What were our successes? Where were we falling
short of the vision of mercy Pope Francis laid out for this Jubilee Year? How could we
open ourselves to God’s surprises in ways that might push us in new, untried directions?</p>
<p>During six weeks of intensive discussions with the Pastoral Vision Council and the
parish staff, we explored these and other questions in depth. And I’ll be frank with you—we 
didn’t come up with all the answers! But we did come up with some key themes for us
as a parish to focus on in the next five years. The themes are listed below; each is followed
by a series of questions, which I am hoping you will give some serious thought to, much
as our Pastoral Vision Council and our staff have already done.</p>
<p><b>Welcoming the Stranger</b> How can we make the Cathedral a more welcoming
place? Do we really welcome seekers and strangers? How can we become a community
that is not just focused on itself, but is genuinely outward-looking? With the explosion of
new construction, our Cathedral neighborhood and our city will change drastically in the
next five years. What new challenges will this bring to us? What new opportunities? How
will we meet them? How can we reach out and engage in dialogue with the city around
us?</p>
<p><b>Hospitality</b> One way of making people feel welcome is by being hospitable. Are
we welcoming to those sitting in the pews next to us, or to those we walk into Mass or out
of Mass with? We all know what a difference a simple smile or “hello” can make. How
can we be more welcoming? Can we reach out more warmly to visitors and regulars
alike? How can we make the coffee hour a place where everyone feels at home, not just the
regulars? Are there other opportunities for us to build community by breaking bread
together? How can we make hospitality a way of life at St. James Cathedral?</p>
<p><b>Outreach and “Inreach”</b> In a very large community that worships in a very large
space, doesn’t it make sense to build what Pope Francis calls “a community of small
communities,” where each person has a place, a home? Can we do this by inviting
parishioners to truly get involved in the parish, participating in one or another of our
many ministries? Our parishioners live all over King County and beyond: how can we
form community out in our many neighborhoods (e.g. by getting together in small study
groups)? Are there other ways of extending the Sunday Mass community to the other six
days of the week—especially when we live so far from one another?</p>
<p><b>Telling Our Story</b> So many of the good things that happen at St. James Cathedral
go unnoticed. They are well-kept secrets! Are there more compelling ways to tell the
story of what is going on here day after day, bringing the Gospel to life through the stories
we tell? Social media offer endless possibilities for making connections. Can we do more
to take advantage of the possibilities of technology and social media to share what goes on
in the Cathedral throughout the week, making it easy for more and more people to
participate in the day-to-day life of the Cathedral?</p>
<p>These are just a few of the themes and questions that our Pastoral Vision Council
and our staff found quite exciting to discuss and brainstorm. I am hoping you will find
them exciting, too. I invite you to join me in reflecting on them in the coming months.
And I hope we do more than reflect on them. As I mentioned, the Pastoral Team will be
setting specific goals in response to these questions. What if you were to set some of your
own goals? <i>In the weeks to come, we are going to be proposing some very practical possibilities to
help you do just that. Please stay tuned!</i></p>
<p>Pope Francis has written: “The parish is not an outdated institution; precisely
because it possesses great flexibility, it can assume quite different contours depending on
the openness and missionary creativity of the pastor and the community… It is a
community of communities, a sanctuary where the thirsty come to drink in the midst of
their journey, and a center of constant missionary outreach.” I can’t think of better words
to describe this Cathedral parish. So let’s accept Pope Francis’ invitation and be creative! I
don’t know what will come of this new Vision, what new ideas, new ministries, new
communities will be formed. What I do know for certain is that together, we can make this
Cathedral parish even more warm, loving, and welcoming; more centered on the Gospel; a
parish that conveys the image of God’s merciful face in everything we do, every liturgy we
celebrate, every telephone call or email we answer, every new outreach we undertake.
We’ve got work to do, my friends. We really do. Each one of us!</p>

<p>St. James Cathedral, along with the other seventeen
parishes in our South Seattle Deanery, has been
working for the last year on a plan to address the
current and future shortage of priests in the
Archdiocese as well as such issues as lay
leadership, parish collaborations, and the future of
the faith communities in the central and south areas
of the City.</p>
<p>As part of this planning process, our parish
participated in the Disciple Maker Index survey in
January as well as three Deanery wide
convocations and several Focus Groups.
On Sunday, October 23, we will be holding
listening sessions after all three morning masses to
share with you the plan which the Deanery
leadership is submitting to Archbishop Sartain in
December. This is a chance to give your feedback
on the draft plan before it is submitted to the
Archbishop.</p>
