<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>As Archbishop Sartain prepares to take his leave of us, I want to take this 
opportunity to express my gratitude to him for his years of faithful service as 
Archbishop of Seattle.</p>
<p>From the day we first met back in 2010, it was clear to me that God had sent 
a humble, holy shepherd to lead this archdiocese. Everything that happened over 
the next nine years has only served to reinforce that initial impression. Not 
only did he shepherd this church with personal holiness and deep humility, he 
also brought to this ministry a warmth, a wisdom, and a quiet hoy that was 
evident whenever he was with us.</p>
<p>And he loved this Cathedral! Every time he spoke to me about it, he referred 
to it as “our Cathedral.” He loved leading us in prayer, preaching the Word, 
celebrating the sacraments, meeting parishioners, and taking time to visit with 
people living on the margins.</p>
<p>I was privileged to spend a fair amount of time with Archbishop Sartain over 
his years here, and in all my dealings with him I found him to be unfailingly 
kind, wonderfully affirming, a good listener, and every inch a Christian 
gentleman. To say that I will miss him is an understatement.</p>
<p>I know that all of you join me in praying God's richest blessings on 
Archbishop Sartain. And please pray in a special way for his strength and good 
health. Although he will be returning to the South were he will be close to his 
family, he will remain a priest of this archdiocese and, just as importantly, he 
will continue to have an important place in our hearts and in our prayers.</p>
<p><i>Ad multos annos</i>, Archbishop Sartain!</p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited an elderly woman who used to 
work in hospice care. Despite health problems and faltering memory, she 
continues to serve others by helping her neighbors in need. She lives on food 
stamps and federal disability payments but forgot to submit paperwork necessary 
to continue to qualify for those benefits. For three months she received no food 
stamps, and her disability payments stopped. We offered help with food and rent, 
but she chose to put all our money toward rent because she was so afraid of 
eviction. Your donations make this help possible–thank you! <i>Information</i>,
