pay for life's necessities, such as rent, electricity, beds,

generosity is great, but we continue to be asked for
more help than we can provide, especially as rents
keep rising. That means we and those we serve are
deeply grateful for every dollar you share with SVdP – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

	<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Instead of buying bottled water, buy reusable water
bottles and fill them from the tap at home, work or
school. You can also carry empty water bottles (even
metal ones) through airport security and fill them once
you have passed security. This will help remove non-biodegradable
plastic from the waste stream and help
keep it out of our waterways.</p>
	<p><b>ADULT CONFIRMATION</b>. Are you a baptized Catholic
who has not yet been confirmed? Adult preparation
classes for this important sacrament begin Wednesday,
February 21, and continue through early May.

<p><b>PREPARES MINISTRY NEEDS VOLUNTEERS</b>. The cathedral’s new Pregnancy and 
Parenting Support Ministry, PREPARES, offers unconditional, nurturing care to 
families from pregnancy through a child’s fifth birthday. PREPARES recognizes 
that parents need love and ongoing community support in order to choose life in 
difficult circumstances. St. James Cathedral is the first parish to launch 
PREPARES in central Seattle. We are forming teams of volunteers to work with a 
parent or family over the long haul. The model is similar to our existing AIDS 
Care Teams. Although PREPARES is brand new, we already have a waiting list of 
pregnant mothers, single parents, and young families who have asked for help. 
PREPARES is the ideal ministry for people who want to live out their commitment 
to social and economic justice and their belief in the dignity of every human 
life. Please consider stepping forward.
