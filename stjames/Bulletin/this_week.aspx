<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in honor of all
fathers and in loving memory of Thomas E. Long on the
first anniversary of his death.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>THURSDAY EVENING ADORATION</b>. Immediately
following the 5:30pm Mass on Thursday evenings, all

<p><b>ORDINATIONS TO THE PRIESTHOOD</b>. On Saturday, June
22 at 10:00am, all are welcome to the Mass of
Ordination. Three young men will be ordained for
service to the Archdiocese of Seattle.</p>
<p><b>CORPUS CHRISTI PROCESSION</b>. Next Sunday, June 23,
we will have the traditional procession with the Blessed
Sacrament at the end of the 10:00am Mass. It is a joyful
and festive celebration with choirs and bagpipes as we
bring our faith to the streets. Pope Francis has said, “At
the end of Mass, we too will go out; we will go forth
with Jesus, who will pass through the streets of this city.
Jesus wants to dwell among you. Let us open our doors
to him and say: Come, Lord, and visit us. We welcome
you into our hearts, our families and our city. We thank
you because you have prepared for us the food of life
and a place in your Kingdom. Make us active in
preparing your way, joyous in bringing you, who are
life, to others, and thus to bring fraternity, justice and
peace to our streets. Amen.”</p>
<p><b>HOW TO HELP SOMEONE CONTEMPLATING SUICIDE</b>. SafeTALK is a half-day alertness training that

hours to complete the visits. Please contact us for more details and with any
