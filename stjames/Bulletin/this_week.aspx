<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p dir="ltr"><b>OPERATION NIGHTWATCH VOLUNTEER OPENING</b>. A
few times a month, parishioners from St. James prepare
and serve a late-night meal to guests at Operation Nightwatch, an organization that seeks to reduce the
impacts of poverty by providing resources to people
experiencing homelessness. We are currently looking for
a volunteer to help us serve dinner on Second Sundays of
every month. Come join our team! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>REPORT FROM ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b>. Your SVdP
donations made it possible for our Cathedral Vincentians
to do 188 home visits during October, November &
December and help 298 low (or no) income residents of
St James parish who struggle to pay for life's necessities,
such as rent, electricity, beds, food, clothes and basic
hygiene products. Your generosity is great, but we
continue to be asked for more help than we can provide,
especially as rents keep rising. That means we and those
we serve are deeply grateful for every dollar you share
with SVdP – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

Clifford</a>, 206-718-4158.</p>
<p><b>ROSARY</b>. All are welcome to join with a group of
parishioners who pray the rosary together in the Chapel,
Monday through Saturday at 7:40am.</p>
<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Aside from indoor plants creating a cozy and warm
ambience in a house, they are also energy efficient in
the way they release moisture from their leaves
allowing it to hold in heat. Some houseplants like aloe vera can act as an air purifying plant surviving on less
sunlight and water while others such as the Golden
Pothos, one of the most popular household plants, need
indirect light consistently.</p>
<p><b>SUNDAY HOSPITALITY VOLUNTEERS NEEDED</b>. Many
people do not know that there are very few places for
those experiencing food insecurity to get a hot meal on
a Sunday. In order to meet this area of highest need,
St. James is rolling out Early Breakfast, a free Sundaymorning
meal program, starting January 27. The
regular Coffee Hour following the 8am, 10am, and
Noon Masses will remain unchanged; however, we are
in urgent need of volunteers to help at least once a
month with food prep on Saturday afternoons and/or
service and cleanup on Sundays in the early morning.
We are also seeking additional assistance with our
regular Coffee Hour following all Sunday Masses.
These are excellent options for people seeking
volunteer opportunities that fit into their busy work
schedules, or for those looking to complement their
Sunday worship with direct service to those in need.
