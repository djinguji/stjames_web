<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<b>FOR YOUR SAFETY</b>. At each of the weekend Masses a Seattle police officer 
is present on the Cathedral campus. </td></tr></table><p></p>

<i> </i>During the month of November we
pray for all our beloved dead, and in a special way
those who remembered the Cathedral in their will over
these past thirty years. </td></tr></table>

<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in loving memory
of Frank Kenmetz from his son John. Flowers are also from Efren and Fely Belleza 
in celebration of their 50th wedding anniversary. Flowers in the north transcept 
shrine of the Blessed Virgin Mary on November 10 were offered in loving memory 
of Teresita Guerrero from her family.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO</b>. This month, all espresso sales
benefit the Cathedral Kitchen. The Espresso Cart is
open at coffee hour after the 10:00am Mass.</p>
<p><b>PARENTAL NOTIFICATION INITIATIVE</b>. Washington is
one of only six states in the country that do not require
any parental involvement before a minor can have an
abortion. To change this policy, the bishops of
Washington State support an initiative to the
legislature. I-1004 would require physicians to notify a
parent or guardian before performing an abortion on a
minor. The initiative does not require parental
permission, only parental notification. I-1004 contains
reasonable exceptions to protect minors in cases where
notification may threaten the minor’s safety or where a
valid medical exemption is present. Failure to comply
with the law would carry criminal penalties and
provide grounds for civil claims. January 4, 2020 is the
deadline for submission of 320,000 signatures of
registered voters to the office of the Secretary of State.
Petitions will be available to sign through December 1
at the Sunday morning coffee hours and in the west
vestibule of the cathedral after 5:30 Masses. More
information about this initiative can be found at

<p><b>ADVENT GIVING TREE</b>. Consider offering a Christmas
gift to a person in need through the St. James Advent
Giving Tree. This year’s partners include the Skagit
Valley Youth Migrant Project, PREPARES, and
several immigration services in Seattle. <i>This year’s
Advent Giving Tree will be in the Cathedral and at
Coffee Hour beginning TODAY Sunday, November 24</i>.</p>
<p><b>MASS OF THANKSGIVING DAY</b>. There will be one Mass on Thanksgiving Day, 
November 28, at 9:30 am. At this Mass, you will be invited to come forward to 
the altar at offertory time with your gift of non-perishable food items for 
those who are struggling at this time. All donations will be distributed by St. 
Mary's Food Bank. This is a wonderful Thanksgiving tradition at St. James 
Cathedral and all are encouraged to attend.</p>
<p><b>PARISH OFFICE CLOSURE</b>. The parish office will be closed on Thursday, 
November 28 and Friday, November 29, in observance of the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<p><b>SACRIFICIAL SUNDAY GIVING</b>. If you haven’t already
done so, please remember to drop your commitment
card for 2020 in the offering basket this weekend. Your
pledge makes it possible for the Cathedral to plan its
budget in the coming year. If you donate via Our
Sunday Visitor, be sure to login and update your giving
preferences there. Thank you so much for your ongoing
support of the Cathedral parish. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ASSISTED LISTENING DEVICES</b>. If you have trouble
hearing the spoken word during Mass, the Cathedral
offers assisted listening devices which provide crystal
clear sound. Listening devices are always available to
borrow—just ask an usher. In addition, if you are a
regular who would like to purchase your own listening
device to use whenever you come to Mass, please
contact

<p><b>CATHEDRAL BLOOD DRIVE</b>. Monday, December 9, 12:30 pm - 6:30 pm (closed 
2:30 - 3:30 pm). What better gift than the gift of life! Please thoughtfully 
consider donating blood during the holy season of Advent. Blood donors have a 
profound life-giving impact on our entire community, including those with acute 
needs due to injury and accident, those who require transfusions to combat the 
effects of chemotherapy, those who live with chronic illnesses and need blood 
transfusions to survive, those undergoing organ transplants. Each blood donation 
can help up to 3 lives. How many lives will you save? Sign up at the Welcome 
Desk at Coffee Hours on 11/24, 12/1, and 12/8 or schedule an appointment at

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A young woman worked in a warehouse to 
pay her way through college. Then her employer outsourced warehouse work. She 
lost her job. Soon she started part-time jobs in a shoe store and commercial 
kitchen. But her landlord threatened eviction, unwilling to wait for his first 
paychecks from the new jobs. She thanked us when we helped with enough rent to 
keep her housed. Within days, she thanked up a second time and proudly told us 
she had just gotten the news that she would receive a college scholarship that 
is awarded to only a few students in the country each year. Your donations to 
SVdP make thanksgiving a year-round event! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>SUPPORT THE WINTER SHELTER</b>. Consider joining the Winter Shelter team! 
We have openings for overnight volunteers for Sunday nights, and breakfast hosts 
for Sundays, Mondays and Tuesdays. We also need volunteers who can substitute in 
case our regular volunteers are unavailable. If you cannot be an overnight host 
or provide breakfast, you can support the Winter Shelter by donating: spray 
deodorant, large tubes of toothpaste, cough drops, hand warmers, travel-size 
tissues, and lip balm. Items can be brought to Coffee Hour, or dropped off or 
mailed to the Parish Office. Thank you! <i>Information</i>,
