<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>The last couple of months have been among the busiest I can
remember. In addition to the usual round of Confirmations, Baccalaureates,
and graduations we have every spring, we had two major archdiocesan
celebrations: the ordination of our new auxiliary bishop, Daniel
Mueggenborg, followed by the ordination of four new priests for the
archdiocese. And, of course, there were, as always, a good number of
baptisms, weddings, and funerals. It’s seldom, if ever, quiet at St. James
Cathedral!</p>
<p>Even so, we are going to take advantage of what we hope will be a
summer lull to do some necessary maintenance work on the cathedral chapel.
You may have noticed that the chapel’s south wall has some serious plaster
problems which must be attended to and doing that will necessitate
repainting the entire chapel. It’s been twenty-five years since the chapel was
last painted, so it’s time!</p>
<p>During the several weeks involved in this project, the chapel will be
closed.</p>
<p>Future maintenance projects (that will begin in the fall) will involve
major work on the beautiful decorative terra cotta at the upper levels of both
Cathedral towers. As you might expect, the ravages of time and weather on
an historic building like ours demands the periodic expenditure of significant
amounts of money.</p>
<p>Stay tuned. It’s unlikely that we will run out of projects like these very
soon. Happy summer!</p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
delightful grandpa with no income who had to move
out of his longtime apartment several months before,
leaving behind a large waterbed filled with memories
of his “grand babies” making the water slosh back and
forth with laughter before they would settle down to
sleep. At his new apartment, his adult children give
him what financial support they can. But they could
not afford a bed, and he was having great difficulty
sleeping on a borrowed and very lumpy old futon. We
could not provide a new water bed but did give him a
new, “standard” bed that made him very happy. Thank
you for giving grandpa the gift of sleep! <i>Information</i>,

and only the utensils you need. Encourage others to do
the same. And remember that all plates, utensils and
cups used at the Cathedral are compostable.</p>
