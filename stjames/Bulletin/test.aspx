<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<p><b>CHRISTMAS CROWDS</b>. Parishioners, please note that the
Christmas Eve Masses tend to be very crowded, with
almost as many people standing as sitting at the 5:30pm
Vigil and 10:00pm Masses. Let’s be as welcoming as
possible to our guests and visitors during the coming
holy days! If you prefer not to brave the crowds (and to
keep your usual seat!), consider attending one of our
Christmas Day Masses, especially the 8:00am, 10:00am
or the 5:30pm on Tuesday, December 25.</p>
<p><b>ADVENT GIVING TREE THANKS</b>. Thank you to all who
have supported this year’s Giving Tree. This is the final
weekend to turn in your Giving Tree gifts, to Coffee
Hour or the Bookstore. Our partners at the Frederick Ozanam House, the King County Juvenile Detention
Center, the Skagit Valley Youth Migrant Project, and
PREPARES thank you for your generous giving spirit!</p>
<p><b>RACIAL JUSTICE DIALOGUES</b>. Today’s scriptures
remind us that God brings peace, “for now his greatness
shall reach to the ends of the earth.” How do we join in
the work to bring peace and healing? Join us for this
five-week series for parishioners who desire to more
deeply explore questions at the intersection of faith and
racial justice. Mondays, January 21–February 25.
Registration required by January 15 at

Hall. RSVP to

<p><b>THE ST. JAMES WINTER SHELTER</b> can welcome up to
266 individuals in one month. Our hospitality provides
toiletries, many of which are used one-time only. That
means that many toothbrushes and razors are needed
for our male guests. These donations are gratefully
accepted, and can be brought to Coffee Hour or the
Parish Office, or ordered for delivery to the Cathedral.</p>
<p><b>COMING IN JANUARY: NAMI PEER-TO-PEER
SUPPORT GROUP</b> Tuesdays, January 15 – March 5,
6:00 – 8:30pm, Pastoral Outreach Center, Mother
Cabrini Room. NAMI peer-to-peer is a free 8-week
educational program for adults with mental illness who
are looking to better understand their condition and
journey toward recovery. Taught by a trained team of
people who’ve been there, the program includes
presentations, discussion, and interactive exercises.
Everything is confidential and NAMI never
recommends a specific medical therapy or treatment
approach. “It made me feel I was not alone in coping
with mental illness. It gave me hope that I could
recover and that my life would not always be filled
with chaos and it gave me positive role models to
inspire me to strive for recuperation and success in
life”. RSVP to

<p><b>SCAM ALERT!</b> Cybercrime is hitting dioceses
nationwide. If you receive a message from Father
Ryan from a @gmail address asking for help or requesting you to purchase a gift

any request you receive from the parish. Thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. One of our
members recently answered a phone call at the SVdP
Helpline (206-767-6449) from a dad living in a nearby
parish with his two pre-school boys. He cried as he
struggled to ask, “Is there any way you can help me
buy Christmas gifts for my sons?” The good news is
his request was then handled by the local SVdP group
in his area. Meanwhile, another local parish (St Jude in
Redmond) gave us QFC and Target gift cards to share
with a few St James families in need of Christmas
help. Among those we visited was a man who lives
only a few blocks from the Cathedral with his wife and
four children, ages 1 to 12. When we handed this man
Christmas gift cards, he and his wife responded with
tears of gratitude, hugs and many cries of “God bless!”
Thank you for helping us dry the tears of some men
and cause others to cry with joy – your donations to
SVdP make a difference in many of our neighbors’
lives! <i>Information</i>,
