<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>It is a joy to be able to welcome you to St. James Cathedral on this Easter of 2012.
I welcome you in the name of our Archbishop, J. Peter Sartain, as well as in my own.</p>
<p>Of all the times we gather as Christian believers, none is more important than
Easter — the greatest of all our feasts. Easter celebrates the Mystery that is the very
foundation of our Christian faith, for, as St. Paul wrote, “If Christ has not risen, our faith
is in vain.” (1 Cor. 15:14)</p>
<p>But Christ has risen and your presence here in the Cathedral both affirms and
celebrates that most startling and enduring of all realities! While we do not see him, we
know he lives and that he is in our midst breathing life and hope into us, walking alongside
us on our pilgrimage of faith, our journey toward the Kingdom.</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing what is in your heart as you come here on this Easter
Sunday. For some, I am sure, there is joy and a keen sense of hope for the future as
spring with its promise of new life bursts forth all around us; for others there may be the
burden of pain that comes from a serious illness, or a family crisis, or losing a job, or the
death of a loved one. For others, this may be the Easter that you’ve decided to become
more serious and intentional about the practice of your Catholic faith—or at least to
explore that possibility.</p>
<p>I simply want you to know that whether you have come here today in joy or
sadness, hope or uncertainty, you are welcome. And I sincerely hope that you will find
here at St. James Cathedral something that will comfort you, challenge you, and lift you
up. We live in a world that, while incredibly beautiful, is also seriously flawed. Death
and life are never very far away from us, are they? But Easter boldly proclaims that
death is not the end of the story. Easter proclaims for all to hear that Life gets the last
word, not death!</p>
<p>My prayer today is that you will be renewed in faith and hope as you join in
worship here at St. James Cathedral.</p>
<p>If you are a visitor, please know that we warmly welcome you. May you find
here something today that will touch your heart, awaken your spirit, and make you want
to return to this holy place again. And if you are part of the parish family of St. James, I
take this opportunity to thank you for all the ways you make the Risen Lord Jesus
present in this parish and in this city day after day: through your prayer, your faith, and
your love that overflows in generous and unselfish service, especially to the poor.</p>
<p>May the blessings of the Risen Lord Jesus be yours in abundance.</p>
