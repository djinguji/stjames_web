<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND/OR 
BECOMING CATHOLIC?</b> You are invited to participate in the RCIA,
a process of initiation into the Catholic community of

Scripture, Catholic teaching, and Christian values—the
development and deepening of a life of prayer and
action—all with the support and involvement of the
parish community. You can learn more by going to the <a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA">RCIA

sometimes have to listen, much to our regret, to
voices of persons who, though burning with
zeal, are not endowed with too much sense of
discretion or measure. In these modern times
they can see nothing but prevarication and ruin.
They say that our era, in comparison with past
eras, is getting worse and they behave as
though they had learned nothing from history,
which is, nonetheless, the teacher of life… We
feel we must disagree with these prophets of
doom who are always forecasting disaster, as
though the end of the world were
at hand.”</p>

	<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During July we made 74 home
visits to our low income neighbors. Your contributions
allowed us to help 51 individuals and families pay their
rent and stay safely in their homes. In addition, we
prevented 10 utility shut-offs, provided food for 28
families, beds and furniture for 15 households, clothes
for 11 people, and transportation assistance for 6
individuals. Our priority is preventing homelessness.
This makes your contributions go a long way. Helping
our neighbors pay their rent is far cheaper than picking
up the pieces after they lose their homes. Members of
the St. Vincent de Paul Society follow Jesus through
service to those in need. Bearing witness to Christ’s
compassionate and liberating love, we show our
commitment through person-to-person contact, making
our home visits in pairs. Please consider joining our
ministry to the poor among us. <i>Information</i>, Rob Millar

<p><b>WILL YOU ASSIST A PERSON WHO WANTS TO

them to our community. The time commitment is
reasonable – two Wednesday evening sessions a month.

assist in setting up, greeting participants, and putting
things away for our weekly RCIA gathering. The time
