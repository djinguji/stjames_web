<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO</b>. Stop by Cathedral Hall after
the 10:00am Mass today for a latte or mocha. All
proceeds during the month of May benefit our Emmaus
Companion ministry.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are in loving memory of
Nancy Flohr, from her husband Ned.</p>
<p><b>HEALTH FAIR</b>. The seventh annual Health Fair will be
held TODAY at the coffee hours following the 10:00am
and noon Masses. The Health Fair focuses on human and
environmental health – and how we can be caring and
effective stewards of our bodies as well as our
environment. More than twenty local health,
environmental and government organizations will be
represented. Join us in Cathedral Hall to ask questions
and collect valuable information.</p>
<p><b>ICON OF THE RESURRECTION</b>. This weekend, St. James
Cathedral is privileged to host a beautiful icon of
Christ’s Resurrection. The icon, written by Yakov
Prokofiev of St. Petersburg, was commissioned by the
St. Petersburg Seattle Sister Churches Board to celebrate
the 20th anniversary of their program, which encourages
friendly relations between churches in Seattle and St.
Petersburg. The icon was blessed by Metropolitan
Vladimir and brought to Seattle in the summer of
2011. During this Easter Season, it has traveled around
the Pacific Northwest to churches of many Christian
denominations. Special thanks to Jane and Dick Carter
for making the icon available to St. James.</p>

<p><b>WILL YOU ASSIST A PERSON WHO WANTS TO
BECOME CATHOLIC?</b> We continue to have new
inquirers coming to participate in our Christian
Initiation process to learn more about the Catholic
Church (RCIA). We need St. James parishioners to be
companions with our new inquirers to help welcome
them to our community. The time commitment is
reasonable – two Wednesday evening sessions a
month. Training and support are provided. The
rewards are many, including renewal and update of
your own faith and “kudos” in heaven. <i>Information</i>,

“few good people” to assist in setting up, greeting
participants, and putting things away for our weekly RCIA gathering. The time commitment is once a
month from 6:00-9:30pm. It is a great way to meet
new people and support an important parish
ministry. <i>Information</i>,
