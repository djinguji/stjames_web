<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>ST. VINCENT DE PAUL</b>. This week we take up our
monthly collection for St. Vincent de Paul. Thank you
for your generous support!</p>
<p><b>PALM SUNDAY PROCESSION</b>. Next Sunday is Palm
Sunday. At 10:00am Mass, please come straight to the
O’Dea Gym for the blessing of palms and the
procession. Please note that the Cathedral will be
<i><b>closed</b></i> until after the procession. Thank you for your
understanding and joyful participation.</p>
<p><b>LENTEN PRAYER PARTNERS FOR THE ELECT</b>. It’s not
too late to become a prayer partner! Pick up a prayer
card for one of our Elect in the north aisle, and pray
every day during the remainder of Lent for him/her. Notes and cards will be collected during Holy
Week to be given to the Elect before Easter. You can
also <a href="../../Events/2012/bookoftheelect.htm">meet our Elect</a> 
on our parish website. Your prayers make a difference!

<p><b>JOURNEY OF THE ELECT</b>. This week we celebrate the
third and final Scrutiny with the Gospel story of the
raising of Lazarus. The Elect are asked to think about
what needs to die in their lives in order for them to
receive the new life being offered to them in
baptism. For some, the question of whether they even
want to come out of the tomb is important, whether
they are willing to risk coming out into the light of
Christ to see what awaits them. This week they will
also be presented with the Lord’s Prayer. As they
approach these last days of preparation before baptism,
keep them in your prayers.</p>
<p><b>JUNIOR HIGH RALLY</b>. Last Saturday, March 10, five
youth parishioners participated in the Archdiocesan Jr.
High Rally. They even did great in leading the opening
prayer before the second general session. Kudos to
you! A big thank you to all who supported this event
and helped with the bake sale. Special thanks to our
wonderful chaperones whose presence and guidance
made it all happen.</p>

<p><b>CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES’ OPERATION RICE BOWL</b>.
This week through Operation Rice Bowl, we learn
about malnourished children and expectant mothers in
India. We pray that we may open our hearts to the
needs of the poor and vulnerable. We fast, not merely
from our excess, but from our very substance, so that
new life may come to all who suffer from poverty,
illness and injustice. We give so that CRS-trained
health care workers can help improve the lives of
women and children throughout the world.</p>
<p><b>MENTAL HEALTH CAREGIVERS</b>. The St. James Mental
Health Ministry is offering a series of biblically-based

the Bible’s Songs of Petition and Praise</i> will run for six
Thursdays, from 7:00-8:30pm, in the Gallagher Center,

comfort and healing words found in the Psalms and
help family members, who often lack the support they
need, to understand and cope with their loved one’s
mental illness. <i>Information or to register</i>,
