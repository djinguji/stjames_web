week through Operation Rice

<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. We were very busy during
February, making a total of 72 home visits to our low
income neighbors. Your contributions allowed us to
keep 48 individuals and families from being evicted
from their homes, and to keep 10 households from
having their utilities shut off. We provided food for 39
families and helped 6 people with transportation. We
provided beds and furniture to 3 households, and
clothes and housewares to 16 others. Members of the
St. Vincent de Paul Society follow Jesus through
service to those in need. Bearing witness to Christ’s
compassionate and liberating love, we show our
commitment through person-to-person contact, making
our home visits in pairs. Please consider joining our
ministry to the poor among us. <i>Information</i>, Rob Millar
