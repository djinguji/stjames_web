<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James is
proud to welcome visitors from near and far
throughout the summer months. Each week a
drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from
among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your
address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and
drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your
presence in our midst today. You are most welcome in this
holy place.</i></p>
<p><b>NEW ON THE WEBSITE</b>. Visit view albums of recent events,
including last weekend’s <a href="../../Events/2012/album-ordination.htm">Ordination to the Priesthood</a>
and wonderful <a href="../../Events/2012/album-corpus.htm">Corpus Christi Procession</a>.</p>
<p><b>INTRODUCING… CAMINO SEATTLE!</b> This summer, in
the weeks leading up to the Feast of St. James, the
whole parish community is invited to embark on a five-week walking and prayer 
adventure called <i>Camino Seattle</i>. You’re invited to create your own 
walking and prayer goal and set out on “pilgrimage” on June 24. Participants 
will receive a passport, which you can fill with stamps each week during the 
Camino. All are welcome—why not get a friend to walk with you? Visit the <a href="../../camino/caminomain.htm"><i>Camino Seattle</i> 
webpage</a> for more information. Sign up after all Masses this weekend!</p>
<p><b>HELP A NEIGHBOR IN NEED</b>. Many of our neighbors
need help with transportation, shopping, laundry, and
housework. Advanced age, chronic illness and
financial difficulties can keep them from
accomplishing these routine daily tasks on their own.
By volunteering just a few hours a month with
Volunteer Chore Services, you can help someone in
our community continue living at own home. Find out more about
VCS by attending a brief informational session
TODAY Sunday, June 10 from 11:15 to 11:45 am in the
Mother Mary Rose Room of the Pastoral Outreach
Center (907 Columbia). <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>PRIESTS’ DAYS</b>. This coming week, June 18-21, the
priests of the Archdiocese will gather for their annual
retreat in Ocean Shores. We will have Masses at
5:30pm on Monday, June 18, Tuesday, June 19, and
Thursday, June 21. Each morning at 8:15am, and at
5:30pm on Wednesday, June 20, there will be an
opportunity to pray the Liturgy of the Hours and to
receive Holy Communion. The regular Mass schedule
will resume on Friday, June 21.</p>
<p><b>WILL YOU ASSIST A PERSON WHO WANTS TO
BECOME CATHOLIC?</b> We continue to have new
inquirers coming to participate in our Christian
Initiation process to learn more about the Catholic
Church (RCIA). We need St. James parishioners to be
companions with our new inquirers to help welcome
them to our community. The time commitment is
reasonable – two Wednesday evening sessions a
month. Training and support are provided. The
rewards are many, including renewal and update of
your own faith and “kudos” in heaven. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST. JAMES VOTER REGISTRATION PROJECT 2012</b>.
Some graduates of the St. James JustFaith class of 2009 are responding to the 
call of Catholic Social Teaching to promote participation in civic life by 
helping people in the cathedral neighborhood, particularly the poor and 
homeless, register to vote during this presidential election year. We are 
completely non-partisan and do not support or oppose any political party or 
issue. We need volunteers who can give 90-minutes of their time to help our 
neighbors get registered for the first time, confirm their prior registrations, 
or re-register at their current address. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During May we made a total of
57 home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions helped us to keep 37 individuals and
families in their homes, and to prevent 6 utility shutoffs.
We provided food for 17 households and clothes
for 4 people. We also gave out 11 vouchers for beds
and furniture, and helped 6 people with transportation
costs. Members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society
follow Jesus through service to those in need. We show
our commitment through person-to-person contact,
always making our home visits in pairs. Please consider
joining our ministry to the poor among us. <i>Information</i>,
Rob Millar, 206-954-8902 and Tammy Bendix, 206-595-9158.</p>
<p><b>IS HOSPITALITY YOUR GIFT?</b> We are looking for a
“few good people” to assist in setting up, greeting
participants, and putting things away for our weekly RCIA gathering. The time commitment is once a
month from 6:00-9:30pm. It is a great way to meet
new people and support an important parish
ministry. <i>Information</i>,
