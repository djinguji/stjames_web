<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James is
proud to welcome visitors from near and far
throughout the summer months. Each week a
drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from
among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your
address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and
drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your
presence in our midst today. You are most welcome in this
holy place! <b>Last week, we had visitors from 
Toms River, NJ;
Clinton Township, MI; Fresno, CA, and many other
places. The winner of our drawing was from
Brownstown, MI.

<p><b>SOUND SYSTEM SURVEY</b>. Thank you to all who
participated in last weekend’s survey about our Cathedral
sound system. Given the volume of responses we
received, it will take some time to tabulate all of them.
However, we intend to report back to you on the results
before the end of the summer.</p>
<p><b>ROSARY WALK TODAY AFTER 10:00AM MASS</b>. You’re
invited to join a special Camino Seattle walk today. We’ll

to Ignatius Chapel, Immaculate Conception, Holy Names
Academy, and St. Joseph’s Parish, praying the rosary
along the way. The walk is a little over four miles. All
are welcome!</p>
<p><b>CAMINO SEATTLE IS IN ITS FINAL STRETCH</b>. You can
collect your stamps for the week at coffee hours after the
morning Masses, or in the Bookstore following the
evening Masses. Be sure to come to the 10:00am or Noon
Mass next Sunday, the Feast of St. James, for a special
blessing. All Camino Seattle participants will receive a
gift at the Parish Picnic as well! <a href="../../camino/caminomain.htm"><i>Camino Seattle</i></a>.</p>

<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. June was a very busy month. We
made a total of 84 home visits to our low income
neighbors! Your contributions allowed us to keep 54
individuals and families from being evicted from their
homes, and to prevent utility shut-offs for 11
households. We provided food for 26 families, beds and
furniture for 11 households, and clothes for 3 people.
We also assisted 9 people with transportation costs. Our
priority is preventing homelessness, which makes your
contributions go a long way. Helping our neighbors pay
their rent is far cheaper than picking up the pieces after
they lose their homes. Members of the St. Vincent de
Paul Society bear witness to Christ’s compassionate
and liberating love, through person-to-person contact,
making our home visits in pairs. Please consider joining
our ministry to the poor among us. Information, Rob
Millar 206-954-8902 and Tammy Bendix 206-595-9158.</p>

warning: ‘Learn of me, for I am meek and
humble of heart.’ Dazzled by the television
lights, I could see nothing but an amorphous,
swaying mass. I blessed Rome and the world as
though I were a blind man. As I came away I
thought of all the cameras and lights that from
now on, at every moment, would be directed on
me. And I said to myself: if you don’t remain a
disciple of the gentle and humble Master, you’ll
understand nothing even of temporal
realities. Then you’ll really be blind.”</p>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Mary
Magdalene in Everett, St. Ann in Seattle, Tacoma, and Forks;
and St. Olaf in Poulsbo.</p>
