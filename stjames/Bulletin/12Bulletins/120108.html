want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

willing to come in around 3:30pm and be the pots and

November 25, 1881, in Sotto il Monte, a village of 1200
inhabitants at the foot of the Alps. The Roncallis had
lived there since 1429. The house where Angelo was born
was called the “palazzo” but it was not much like a
palace: the large family shared the ground floor with
their cows. “We were poor but happy
with our lot and confident in the help of
Providence…. When a beggar appeared at
the door of our kitchen, there was always
room for him, and my mother would
hasten to seat this stranger alongside us.”</p>
