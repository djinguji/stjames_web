<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>It has been quite a summer at St. James Cathedral, and anything but
quiet. Over the past three months or so, we celebrated a lot of weddings
and, sadly, a record number of funerals, giving back to God some
wonderful parishioners and friends.</p>
<p>We also finished up the Annual Catholic Appeal remarkably well, even
though we fell short of the goal we were hoping for. For a number of
reasons, it was a difficult time to promote the Appeal, but, thanks to the
generosity of more than 950 of you, we did remarkably well. In the end, we
were only $20,000 short of our combined archdiocesan and parish goal of
$526,676.</p>
<p>During June and July, several hundred of you participated in the
Camino Seattle, exploring the beauties of the city and the surrounding
area, praying along the way, meeting new friends, and maybe even
shedding a pound or two! It all culminated at the annual celebration of the
Feast of St. James, when we pulled out all the stops at the Sunday Masses
and enjoyed a fabulous parish picnic afterwards on a picture-perfect July
Sunday. Special thanks to Trent and Alex Mummery and Stephen Pace,
along with an army of great volunteers who made it all happen.</p>
<p>Then there was Choir Camp when the Cathedral and the entire
campus echoed with the happy and beautiful sounds of more than 50
young people from ages 9 to 14. If you want to get an idea of what Choir
Camp is all about (my words will not do it!), I suggest you check out the
Cathedral website. You’ll be mightily impressed, believe me.</p>
<p>And now, the realities of fall -- back to school, and back to work -- are
staring us in the face. Here at the parish, this is going to mean a few
changes that I am excited to be able to share with you.</p>
<p>After a good deal of praying and planning, and in response to things
you told us in parish survey that we conducted back in the fall of 2010, we
are reorganizing the way we minister to families. Of course, we have
always ministered to families, assisting young couples preparing for
marriage, following them through the early years of family life with the
arrival of children and the celebration of baptism, and continuing into the
years of children’s faith-formation. The idea of the new ministry is to
consolidate some work that had been spread among several staff members
and to coordinate these existing ministries more effectively while
expanding marriage enrichment programs, increasing support for families
experiencing difficulties and challenges, and assisting divorced Catholics
who seek healing and understanding from the Church.</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce that Suzanne Lee, who has been ministering
in our social outreach and advocacy programs with Patty Bowman for the
past few years, has accepted the challenge of building and coordinating
this new ministry. I am grateful to Suzanne for her willingness – and
eagerness – to take on this major set of responsibilities.</p>
<p>Taking up some of Suzanne’s former duties and involvements in the
social outreach and advocacy area is the newest member of our team,
Caitlin Lanigan. I am delighted to welcome Caitlin to St, James and to our
staff. She is a graduate of Holy Cross College and has just completed a
year serving at Seattle’s Urban Rest Stop as a Jesuit Volunteer. I know
Caitlin will bring energy, ideas, and a strong commitment to our Outreach
ministries and I also know that our many volunteers will enjoy working
with her. If you’re at the hospitality after one of the morning Masses
today, I hope you’ll take a moment to introduce yourself and welcome her
to St. James!</p>

<p>P.S. Tomorrow evening, Monday, September 10, at 7:00pm, Bishop Robert
McElroy, auxiliary bishop of San Francisco, will give the fourth in our yearlong
lecture series celebrating the 50th anniversary of the opening of the
Second Vatican Council. Bishop McElroy is a distinguished scholar,
church leader, and pastor, whose writings on contemporary issues facing
the Church—including religious liberty, war and peace, and other issues
especially relevant during this election year—have deservedly gained
national attention. It is a privilege to welcome Bishop McElroy to St. James
and I hope many of you will avail yourselves of the opportunity to hear
him speak.</p>
