<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from Julia Richardt in
memory of her grandmother Gerta Hocke, who died
March 21 in Kassel, Germany at the age of 91.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO</b>. Stop by Cathedral Hall after
the 10:00am Mass today for a latte or mocha. All
proceeds during the month of April benefit our
babysitting program.</p>

<p><b>FIRST FRIDAY EXPOSITION AND HOLY HOUR</b>. On
Friday, May 4, we will have Exposition of the Blessed
Sacrament following the 8:15am Mass, and continuing
until 1:00pm. There will be a Holy Hour at 12 Noon
with Midday Prayer and rosary. What a wonderful
way to begin “Mary’s month”! All are welcome.</p>
<p><b>MHM RESOURCE CENTER GRAND OPENING</b>. Today,
Sunday, April 29, from 9am-2pm, you’re invited to
the grand opening of the Mental Health Ministry
Resource Center. Stop by the Gallagher Center (enter
off Columbia Street) for resources and information
related to mental health/illness, emotional distress and
living well. We also provide referrals to professional
and medical assistance, and companioning. We will
also offer blood pressure checks and information
related to stress. The resource center will be open on
the last Sunday of each month.</p>

	<p><b>OUR VATICAN II LECTURE SERIES CONTINUES: VATICAN II AND SCRIPTURE</b>. Father James Eblen,
noted Scripture scholar and priest of the Archdiocese
of Seattle, will give the second in our Vatican II
Lecture Series on Monday, April 30 at 7:00pm in
Cathedral Place Hall. Father Eblen will explore the
Council’s seminal document on Scripture and
revelation, <i>Dei Verbum</i>. “Such force and power are
present in the word of God that it remains the
Church’s support and source of energy, and for her
children a strengthening of the faith, a food of the
soul, and never failing source of spiritual life… For
Christ’s faithful the approach to holy Scripture should
lie wide open.” (<i>Dei Verbum</i>)</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>ARE YOU A CATHOLIC WHO HAS BEEN AWAY FROM
THE CHURCH?</b> Our Welcome Back program provides a safe place, in the company 
of others who are also examining their faith, to ask questions about returning 
to regular church attendance and the sacraments, and to learn about changes in 
the church. The sessions are offered on Mondays, April 23 through July 16, 
7:00-9:00pm on 2nd floor Cathedral Place. Classes are offered without any 
obligation.

<p><b>WOULD YOU CONSIDER ASSISTING A PERSON</b> who
wants to become Catholic? We continue to have new
inquirers coming to participate in our Christian
Initiation process to learn more about the Catholic
Church (RCIA). We need St. James parishioners to be
companions with our new inquirers to help welcome
them to our community. The time commitment is
reasonable – two Wednesday evening sessions a
month. Training and support are provided. The
rewards are many, including renewal and update of
your own faith and “kudos” in heaven. <i>Information</i>,

stubbornly on his knees while the Pope was
giving him some instructions. “Get up now and
sit in this chair,” the Pope asked.
</p>
		<p>“Holy Father, I am quite comfortable on my
knees. I am used to a position which I always
took in the presence of
your predecessors.”

your knees, but not to

in Puyallup and St. Philip in Woodland, and the mission
