Vatican Council, will be established in the north aisle of the

<p><img border="0" src="../../images/johnxxiii.png" width="133" height="121" align="right">“A question was raised in a meeting I had with
the Secretary of State, Cardinal Tardini, which
led on to a discussion about the way the world
was plunged into so many grave anxieties and
troubles… What should the Church do? Should
Christ’s mystical barque simply drift along,
tossed this way and that by the ebb and flow of
the tides? Instead of issuing new warnings,
shouldn’t she stand out as a beacon of light?
What could that exemplary light be? Suddenly
my soul was illumined by a great idea which
came precisely at that moment and which I
welcomed with ineffable confidence in the
divine Teacher. And there sprang to my lips a
word that was solemn and
committing. My voice uttered
it for the first time: a Council.”</p>
