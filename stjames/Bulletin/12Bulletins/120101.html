<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central

CATHOLIC?</b> You are invited to participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the Catholic
community of faith. It is a process which encompasses
the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching, and Christian
values—the development and deepening of a life of
prayer and action—all with the support and
involvement of the parish community. You can learn more by going to
the <a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA">RCIA website</a>. A
new inquiry session will begin Wednesday, January 11
at 7:00pm in Cathedral Place, second floor.

	<p><b>WOULD YOU CONSIDER ASSISTING A PERSON</b> who
wants to become Catholic? We continue to have new
inquirers coming to participate in our Christian
Initiation process to learn more about the Catholic
Church (RCIA). We need St. James parishioners to be
companions with our new inquirers to help welcome
them to our faith community. The time commitment is
reasonable–two Wednesday evening sessions a
month. Training and support are provided. The
rewards are many, including renewal and update of
your faith and “kudos” in heaven. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN</b> is looking for volunteers
who might be interested in joining our Tuesday crew.
Since two of our team members will be leaving us
soon, we will be without dishwashers for the late

willing to come in around 3:30pm and be the pots and
pans dishwasher (scrubber) and a second volunteer to
run our dish machine from 4:15pm or so until around
5:45pm. Aside from these specific requests we are
always looking for those who would work as part of the
Monday through Friday crew to sweep and mop the
dining hall. This activity begins at 4:45pm or so and
ends by 6:00pm. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially
registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to register</i>.
Registered parishioners receive important mailings
from the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are
regular recipients of the Cathedral’s quarterly journal <i>In
Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate their wedding at the
Cathedral, and their children may attend any of the five
Catholic Rainbow Schools at parishioner rates (and
become eligible for Cathedral scholarship money). In
addition, if you are a registered parishioner and use
envelopes, or are on the direct debit program, we will
mail you a quarterly report of your contributions to the
parish. Registration cards can be found in the vestibule.
Please drop the completed card in the collection basket
or put it in the mail. <i>If you are not sure whether or not
you’re registered, call the Parish Office, 206-622-3559</i>.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight,
and the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect
way to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>FIRST FRIDAY EXPOSITION OF THE BLESSED
SACRAMENT</b>. On Friday, January 6, Exposition of the
Blessed Sacrament will follow the 8:15am Mass and
continue through 1:00pm. A holy hour including
Liturgy of the Hours, silent meditation, and rosary, will
be celebrated from Noon-1:00pm. All are welcome.</p>
<p><b>LISTENING ASSISTANCE DEVICES</b>. If you have trouble
hearing the spoken word in the Cathedral, ask an usher
about using one of our listening assistance devices,
which provide clear and clean sound. Not just for the
hard of hearing!</p>
<p><b>NEED PASTORAL CARE?</b> The Cathedral provides a
variety of such ministries. Whether you are sick or
homebound and in need of communion, whether you
would like a CD of Sunday’s Mass, or if you need the
sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick, we can help!

Simpson</a>, Pastoral Care Minister, 206-274-3173.</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. For those who wish, babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</p>
<p><b>ARCHBISHOP HUNTHAUSEN LIBRARY</b>. Visit your
friendly and accessible Archbishop Hunthausen Library
in Cathedral Hall during the Sunday coffee hours. We
have a good selection of old favorites and recent
releases.</p>
<p><b>CD OF THE SUNDAY MASS</b>. Each Sunday, the 10:00am
Mass is recorded on CD for our homebound
parishioners. If you or someone you know would
benefit from receiving a weekly bulletin and CD
recording by mail, contact
