<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>NEW IN THE BOOKSTORE</b>. Celebrate Advent with good
spiritual reading for the season, including <i>Advent with
the Holy Fathers</i>. Also in stock: Cathedral Christmas
Cards! We also have some wonderful new Christmas
books for children.</p>
<p><b>HUNTHAUSEN FUND CHRISTMAS CARDS</b>. This year,
give a gift that will make a real difference in the life of
a homeless family! The Hunthausen Fund celebrates
its tenth anniversary this year. This unique fund
provides grants and no-interest loans to homeless
families to help them move into permanent housing.
Since October 2001, the Fund has helped more than
380 homeless families into homes of their own. Give a
gift to the Hunthausen Fund in honor of someone
special this year. See the order form in this bulletin for
more information, or contact

<p><b>GIVING TREE</b>. Many thanks to everyone who picked up
a gift tag at our Giving Tree last weekend. There are
still some tags left, so if you haven’t yet done so, be
sure to stop by the Giving Tree at the coffee hours
following the morning masses this Sunday, as well as
in the Hall after the 5:30 pm Sunday mass. All gifts
must be returned no later than next Sunday, December
18, and can be brought to the Hall during coffee hours
or after the 5:30pm Sunday mass.</p>
<p><b>OUR ST. JAMES “WARM HEARTS AND SOLES”</b> 8th annual Advent sock drive for 
homeless men continues today, Sunday, December 11. Your generosity is warming 
our hearts, but we have a long way to go as we collect socks toward our goal of 
2011 pairs for delivery in January. Advent will be drawing to a close before we 
know it, so let’s keep up our efforts by dropping off new socks at the Young 
Adult table in Cathedral Hall after 8:00am, 10:00am, and 12:00 Noon Sunday 
Masses, or during the week at 2nd floor, Cathedral Place. Such a worthwhile 
project–let’s keep those hearts and soles warm this winter! <i>Information</i>

<p><b>ADVENT PENANCE SERVICES</b> will be held on
Saturday, December 17 at 4:00pm and Monday,
December 19 at 7:30pm. During these beautiful
services of readings, reflection and song, we will open
ourselves to experience the gift of God’s gracious and
loving forgiveness in the Sacrament of Penance. It has
long been a tradition in the church to confess one’s sins
before celebrating the great feast of Christmas. These
will be ideal times to do so.</p>

	<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND/OR BECOMING
CATHOLIC?</b> You are invited to participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the Catholic
community of faith. It is a process which encompasses
the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching, and Christian
values—the development and deepening of a life of
prayer and action—all with the support and
involvement of the parish community. You can learn more by going to
the <a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA">RCIA website</a>. A
new inquiry session will begin Wednesday, January 11
at 7:00pm in Cathedral Place, second floor.

	<p><b>WHAT ARE HOLIDAY BLUES?</b> The holidays are
supposed to be a joyful time of good cheer. Yet, it is
not unusual for many of us to feel sad or lonely during
the holiday period—a condition that has come to be
called “holiday blues” or “holiday depression.” For
more information, visit the <a href="../../Education/mentalhealth.htm">Mental 
	Health Ministry</a> page.</p>
<p><b>THANK YOU AND MERRY CHRISTMAS</b>. Last
Wednesday PEMCO spoiled us at the Cathedral
Kitchen with a special Christmas dinner for our guests.
This has become an annual event that we all look
forward to. The chicken breasts, mashed potatoes,
fresh vegetables, rolls, and beautiful holiday cakes and
cookies were delicious. PEMCO employees not only
prepared the dinner, they also set the tables with
poinsettias and served our guests milk, coffee, and
sparkling cider. The McDonald’s gift cards packed
into warm gloves were also very much appreciated by
all. Thank you, PEMCO!</p>
<p><b>WINTER SHELTER DONATIONS</b>. Our shelter guests need
disposable razors, toothbrushes, chapstick, and new or
gently used hand towels and wash cloths. Please bring
your donations to Cathedral Hall during coffee hour
after Sunday Mass or drop them off at the parish office
Monday through Friday, 9am-5pm.</p>
<p><b>NEW LANGUAGE OF THE MASS</b>. On the First Sunday of Advent, along with 
English-speaking Catholics around the world we began using a new translation of 
the Roman Missal, the prayers of the Mass. If you would like to learn more about 
the changes, visit the <a href="../../liturgy/romanmissal/rm3.htm">
