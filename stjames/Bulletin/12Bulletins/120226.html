<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

Cross,” a new art work by local ceramic artists Jessi Li

OPERATION RICE BOWL</b>. St. James
joins millions of Catholics across
the country, who will be
participating in Operation Rice
Bowl during Lent. CRS invites us
to <b>pray</b> with our family and
friends, <b>fast</b> in solidarity with
those who are hungry, <b>learn</b> about our brothers and
sisters around the world, and <b>give</b> <b>alms</b> to help those in
need. The educational material included in each Rice
Bowl explores CRS projects around the world. This
week we focus on subsistence farmers in Madagascar,
who struggle to feed their families on depleted land,
and are now learning improved growing methods with
the help of CRS. Pick up a Rice Bowl at the doors of
the cathedral, take it home, and prepare to be
transformed by this simple but powerful Lenten
practice.</p>

<p><b>SIGN UP TODAY FOR THE LENTEN BLOOD DRIVE</b>. The
blood drive will be on Tuesday, March 20. What could
be a more personal, caring and meaningful gift this
Lenten season than the gift of blood to someone in our
community who has the need? The urgent and ongoing
need for blood donors invites us to consider yet another
aspect of Stewardship, that is, the gift of ourselves in a
way that is fundamental and essential to life itself. If
you have not yet donated, please consider donating for
the first time. If you have donated in the past, please
consider doing so again. Donor signups will be at the
coffee hours after today’s morning Masses. Or call
206-274-3173.</p>
<p><b>BAKE SALE TODAY</b>. Stop by coffee hour TODAY after
the 10:00am and 12:00 Noon Masses for a special bake
sale. All proceeds will help send a group of Cathedral

<p><img border="0" src="../../images/johnxxiii.png" width="133" height="121" align="right">Roncalli was the first to joke about his weight. On meeting the French historian Daniel-Rops
while serving as Apostolic Nuncio in Paris, he
said, “Ah, cher monsieur Daniel-Rops, we will
both have to say a prayer to God, beseeching
Him to remove half the excess fat which I have
and to give it to you!” On another occasion,
after attending a meeting at the French
Academy, he said, “It’s a beautiful, most
impressive place. One hears
beautiful things there.
Unfortunately, the seats are large
enough only for a demi-nuncio.”</p>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Joseph in
Chehalis, Vancouver, and Pe Ell.</p>
