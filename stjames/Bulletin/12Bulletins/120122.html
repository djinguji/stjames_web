<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from David and Shelley Hovind in celebration of their first wedding anniversary.</p>
<p><b>SPIRIT OF PROPHECY ART EXHIBIT IN THE CHAPEL</b>.
Through February 19, our Cathedral Chapel is host to a
special exhibit entitled “The Spirit of Prophecy,”
featuring works by five contemporary artists. Each of
the artists is known for addressing spiritual themes in
works which range from large-scale oils to intimate
woodcuts and mixed media sculpture. A short tour of
the exhibit will be offered immediately following the
Sunday 10:00am Mass and Sunday 5:30pm Masses this
weekend. Simply gather in the Chapel.</p>
<p><b>WILL YOU BE A “SNOW ANGEL”?</b> Due to the snow
storm last Sunday, our Sunday collection was down by
$11,300 (compared to the same week in 2011). If you
missed Mass last Sunday, would you consider making
your usual Sunday and St. Vincent de Paul offering for
last Sunday this week? That will help us make our
budget!</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO</b>. Stop by Cathedral Hall after
the 10:00am Mass today for a latte or mocha. All
proceeds in the month of January benefit our own Care
Team for Persons with AIDS.</p>
<p><b>CONFIRMATION CLASSES FOR ADULTS AND HIGH
SCHOOL STUDENTS</b> 16 years and older begin
Thursday, February 16, 6:30-8:30 pm in Cathedral
Place Room 411. Full sacramental initiation (Baptism,
Confirmation, and Eucharist) is important for all
practicing Catholics, and is particularly important for
those who are considering getting married.

<p><b>ST. JAMES YOUTH MUSIC PROGRAM IS ACCEPTING
NEW SINGERS</b> in to our renowned youth choirs. In the
two training choirs (grades 1-4) young people learn to
participate fully and actively in the Mass through
exciting and innovative musical teaching. Some of the
Northwest’s most highly recognized music educators
will inspire your student with both vocal and
instrumental training. No audition is necessary for the
training choirs. We are also holding auditions for our
other two ensembles, the Schola Cantorum (treble
voices, grades 5-8) and our Young Women's Ensemble,
Jubilate! for upper teens. Scholarships are available.

<p><b>THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU</b> to our generous
parishioners who contributed 2,735 pairs of socks to
our 2011 Advent Warm Hearts and Soles sock drive to
benefit the homeless in our city. We thank our
individual donors as well as our generous corporate
donor, the Zumiez Foundation, for helping us exceed
our goal. In addition to the men’s socks we received
some for women and children, and also some hats,
gloves, and jackets. All are going to organizations we
work with to be distributed to those in need. And many
thanks, too, to our friends who donated their time to
collect socks following the Advent Masses. We are
blessed to have such a caring and generous parish!</p>
<p><b>WOULD YOU CONSIDER ASSISTING A PERSON</b> who
wants to become Catholic? We continue to have new
inquirers coming to participate in our Christian
Initiation process to learn more about the Catholic
Church (RCIA). We need St. James parishioners to be
companions with our new inquirers to help welcome
them to our community. The time commitment is
reasonable–two Wednesday evening sessions a
month. Training and support are provided. The
rewards are many, including renewal and update of
your faith and “kudos” in heaven. <i>Information</i>,

his parish priest. Decades later he could still
recite the counsel attributed to St. Bernard which
hung on the wall of the priest’s study: “Peace
within the cell; fierce warfare without. Hear all;
believe a few; honor all. Do not believe everything
you hear; do not judge everything you see; do not
do everything you can; do not give
everything you have; do not say
everything you know. Pray, read,
withdraw, be silent, be at peace.”</p>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Paul in
Seattle and the Mission Churches of St. Paul in Westport and
on the Swinomish Indian Reservation.</p>
