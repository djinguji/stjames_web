<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FROM THE ARCHBISHOP</b>. In preparation for the November elections, the 
Archbishop has asked us to make available a variety of resources relating to the 
upcoming vote on Referendum 74. Visit the Cathedral website for 
<a href="../../Events/2012/R74/ref74.htm">links</a> to a
video statement by Archbishop Sartain and other
materials you may find helpful. Printed copies of the
materials are also available in the vestibules.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from Ken and Kimberly Meech in loving memory Ken’s beloved mother,
Aileen E. Meech.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO</b> is back from its summer
hiatus! Please come by after the 10:00 Mass. All
proceeds for the month of October benefit the Winter
Shelter. The Espresso Ministry is also looking for
volunteers willing to run the cart after the noon Mass.

<p><b>VATICAN II LECTURE SERIES CONTINUES</b>. On
Monday, October 29, at 7:00pm in Cathedral Hall, we
will be privileged to welcome Father John O’Malley, SJ, the nation’s foremost historian of the Second
Vatican Council. He will help us answer the question
“What Happened at Vatican II?” This is the seventh in
our eight-part series celebrating the 50th Anniversary
of the Council. The series concludes on Thursday,
November 15, with a lecture by Father Michael
Raschko.</p>
<p><b>OUR NEXT ST. JAMES FILM OFFERING</b> is on Tuesday,
October 30 at 7:00pm in Cathedral Place. We will
watch Sun Come Up, an Academy Award nominated
documentary short that will give us a glimpse into the
human face of climate change. The film follows some
of the world’s first “environmental refugees” – the
relocation of a community living on a remote island
chain in the South Pacific. The evening will be co-hosted
by Patty Bowman and TerryAnn Bowen, and
will include an opportunity for discussion of the issues.
Popcorn and lemonade will be provided and you are
welcome to bring your favorite movie treats.

<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During September we made 48
home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions allowed us to help individuals and
families pay their rent and stay safely in their homes. In
addition, we prevented 8 utility shut-offs, provided food
for 23 families, beds and furniture for 11 households,
clothes for 5 people, and transportation assistance for 5
individuals. Our priority is preventing homelessness.
This makes your contributions go a long way. Helping
our neighbors pay their rent is far cheaper than picking
up the pieces after they lose their homes. Members of
the St. Vincent de Paul Society follow Jesus through
service to those in need. Bearing witness to Christ’s
compassionate and liberating love, we show our
commitment through person-to-person contact, making
our home visits in pairs. Please consider joining our
ministry to the poor among us. <i>Information</i>, Rob Millar
