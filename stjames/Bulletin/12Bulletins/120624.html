address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and
drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your
presence in our midst today. You are most welcome in this

process? The JustFaith program is a small-group
process that offers an opportunity to experience a
spiritual journey into compassionate discipleship.
JustFaith provides a lively and challenging format to
engage and be formed by our Catholic faith tradition
that changes lives, inspires compassionate witness and
transforms the world through modeling the love and
justice of God in Jesus Christ. The program includes
readings, videos, conversations about the most difficult
topics, face-to-face encounters with the poor, and an
investigation into the intersection of spirituality and
Christian activism. Come learn more at the Information

<p><b>ST. JAMES VOTER REGISTRATION PROJECT 2012</b>.
Some graduates of the St. James JustFaith class of 2009 are responding to the 
call of Catholic Social Teaching to promote participation in civic life by 
helping people in the cathedral neighborhood, particularly the poor and 
homeless, register to vote during this presidential election year. We are 
completely non-partisan and do not support or oppose any political party or 
issue. We need volunteers who can give 90-minutes of their time to help our 
neighbors get registered for the first time, confirm their prior registrations, 
or re-register at their current address. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>LIVING SOLIDARITY</b>. The Gospel and Catholic Social
Teaching remind us that we are responsible for both
ourselves and the common good. One of the ways in
which we do this is through government, taxes and the
federal budget. What kind of society do we wish to
have? It is vital that all of us engage this question by
bringing our values–not our opinions—to the many
conversations about the economy and the federal
budget. Being informed about and engaged with these
issues is part of our responsibility as citizens and as
people of faith. <i>Living Solidarity: Government, the
Federal Budget and the Common Good</i> is an 8-week
exploration of these issues, including reading and small
group dialogue. Thursday evenings, July 12 through
August 30. Registration required. <i>Information, or to
register</i>,
