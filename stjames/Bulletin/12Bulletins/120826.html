		Dear Friends,<p>On Tuesday, August 21, Archbishop
Raymond Hunthausen celebrated his 91st
birthday, and this coming Thursday, August
30 he will mark the 50th anniversary of his
ordination as a bishop. And in this year when
we are marking the 50th anniversary of the
opening of the Second Vatican Council, it’s
worth mentioning that Archbishop
Hunthausen is the only living American
bishop who participated in all four sessions of
the Council, 1962-1966!</p>
<p>Archbishop Hunthausen was a great
blessing to this Archdiocese during his sixteen
years as our Archbishop, and he continues to
be a blessing to us through his prayers and his
generous support of the ministries of the
Cathedral parish. I know you will want to
join me in offering special prayers for him as
he marks these milestone moments.</p>
