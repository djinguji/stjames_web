<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James is
proud to welcome visitors from near and far
throughout the summer months. Each week a
drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from
among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your
address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and
drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your
presence in our midst today. You are most welcome in this
holy place! <b>Last week, we had visitors from 
Jersey City, NJ;
Orange, CA; Duncan, BC, and many other places.
The winner of our drawing was from Loganville,
GA.
</b></i></p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL PAINT AND REPAIR</b>. You may have
noticed that a significant paint and repair project is
taking place in the west nave of the Cathedral. In the 18
years since the Cathedral was renovated, there has been
some water damage at the upper level and normal wear
and tear at the lower level. <i>Some gifts from generous
parishioners have made it possible for us to take on
this project</i>.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from the Saturday
wedding of Angela Rassilyer and Travis Greenfield.</p>
<p><b>SATURDAY 5:30 CHOIR</b>. We welcome back to St.
James the men’s chant choir, Peregrine, Bill McJohn,
director.</p>
<p><b>CAMINO SEATTLE IS UNDERWAY!</b> You can collect
your stamps for the week at coffee hours after the
morning Masses, or in the Bookstore following the
evening Masses. Also: t-shirts are back in stock in the
Cathedral Bookstore! <a href="../../camino/caminomain.htm"><i>Camino Seattle</i></a>.</p>
<p><b>ANNUAL CATHOLIC APPEAL</b>. We are still $36,368
short of reaching our Annual Catholic Appeal goal for
the year. This past week, a final mailing went out to
those who have not yet responded. If you have not yet
made a donation, please consider doing so today! The
need is urgent! Visit the
<a class="navy" target="_bulletin" href="http://www.seattlearchdiocese.org/aca">
Annual Catholic Appeal</a> website to
make a gift or pledge online.</p>
<p><b>CAMINO STORY NIGHT</b>. Join us on Tuesday, July 17 at
7:00pm in the Cathedral Chapel, for an evening with
pilgrims who have walked the Camino to Santiago de Compostela. They will share the highlights (and the
low points!) of the experience, and talk about the
spiritual meaning of the pilgrimage as well as some of
the practical ins and outs. If you are considering doing
the Camino, or if you just want to travel vicariously,
this evening is for you. There will be plenty of time for
questions and answers as well.</p>
