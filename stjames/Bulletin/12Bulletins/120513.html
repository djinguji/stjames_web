<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO</b>. Stop by Cathedral Hall after
the 10:00am Mass today for a latte or mocha. All
proceeds during the month of May benefit our Emmaus
Companion ministry.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are in memory of Joseph
Forte, from his family.</p>
<p><b>MOTHER’S DAY COLLECTION FOR BABY CORNER</b>. The
Children’s Faith Formation Program and Pregnancy
Support Ministry are collecting diapers, formula, baby clothes and toiletries 
for families who cannot afford these most basic necessities. Donations will be 
accepted at after all Masses this Mother’s Day weekend. Bring your items to the 
parish van parked outside Cathedral Hall. Financial contributions are also 
welcome. Make checks out to St. Joseph’s Baby Corner. <i>Information</i>,

Pope John XXIII with a program of musical treasures

<p><b>ROSARY PROCESSION</b>. Next Sunday, May 20,
immediately following the 12 Noon Mass, we will have
a rosary procession with the children of our Faith
Formation programs. You are invited to bring your
rosary and join in the procession!</p>
<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During April we made a total of
51 home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions helped us keep 32 individuals and
families in their homes, and prevent 9 utility shut-offs.
We provided food for 22 households and clothes for 4
people. In addition, we gave out 11 vouchers for beds
and furniture, and helped 5 people with transportation
costs. Our priority is preventing homelessness, which
makes your contributions go a long way. Helping our
neighbors pay their rent costs us an average of $6 per
bed night. This is far cheaper than picking up the pieces
after people lose their homes. <i>Information</i>, Rob Millar
206-954-8902 and Tammy Bendix 206-595-9158.</p>
<p><b>ALL PARISH CHOIR</b>. This annual celebration of our
great singing community is Sunday, June 17.

the all-new St. Therese Catholic Academy! After
receiving a $500,000 grant funded in large part by the
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, St. Therese will reopen
this August as the first blended technology
learning center in the northwest! St. Therese School is

shrine to Blessed John XXIII, the Pope who called the Second
Vatican Council, will be established in the north aisle of the
Cathedral. Throughout the year, keep an eye on this box in the

<p dir="ltr"><img border="0" src="../../images/johnxxiii.png" width="133" height="121" align="right">John XXIII detested solitude, particularly
during meals. Although protocol required that
a pope dine alone, he could not resign himself
to the rule. “I look like a seminarian under
punishment,” complained the Pope. “I have
read the Gospel over carefully without finding a
single passage which prescribes
that one should eat alone. As we
know, Jesus loved to eat in
company.”</p>
