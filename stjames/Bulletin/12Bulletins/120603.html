<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from the Deuna and Lopez
families in memory of Armando E. Deuna on the 6th
anniversary of his death.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>INTRODUCING… CAMINO SEATTLE!</b> This summer, in
the weeks leading up to the Feast of St. James, the whole
parish community is invited to embark on a five-week
walking and prayer adventure called <i>Camino Seattle</i>.
You’re invited to create your own walking and prayer
goal and set out on “pilgrimage” on June 24. Participants
will receive a passport, which you can fill with stamps
each week during the Camino. All are welcome—why
not get a friend to walk with you? More information can
be found in this week’s bulletin and at the parish
website. Sign ups begin today at coffee hour after
10:00am Mass. Visit the <a href="../../camino/caminomain.htm"><i>Camino Seattle</i> 
webpage</a>. </p>
<p><b>THE JUNE SENIOR TRIP</b> will take place on Wednesday,
June 13. We will visit the newly opened LeMay-America’s Car Museum. It is a gleaming tribute to how
the automobile has shaped American culture and society.
Did you ever sit in a car and watch a drive-in movie? Do
you remember the model your grandfather drove? What
was your own first vehicle? Chances are they’re in the
collection! Please join us as we travel down memory
lane! Space is limited and priority will be given to
registered parishioners. <i>Information, or to reserve your
place</i>,

<p><b>WILL YOU ASSIST A PERSON WHO WANTS TO
BECOME CATHOLIC?</b> We continue to have new
inquirers coming to participate in our Christian
Initiation process to learn more about the Catholic
Church (RCIA). We need St. James parishioners to be
companions with our new inquirers to help welcome
them to our community. The time commitment is
reasonable – two Wednesday evening sessions a
month. Training and support are provided. The
rewards are many, including renewal and update of
your own faith and “kudos” in heaven. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially
registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to register</i>.
Registered parishioners receive important mailings
from the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are
regular recipients of the Cathedral’s quarterly journal <i>In
Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate their wedding at the
Cathedral, and their children may attend any of the five
Catholic Rainbow Schools at parishioner rates.
Registration cards can be found in the vestibule. <i>If you
are not sure whether or not you’re registered, call the
Parish Office, 206-622-3559</i>.</p>

<p><b>ST. JAMES VOTER REGISTRATION PROJECT 2012</b>.
Some graduates of the St. James JustFaith class of 2009
are responding to the call of Catholic Social Teaching
to promote participation in civic life by helping people
in the cathedral neighborhood, particularly the poor and
homeless, register to vote during this presidential
election year. We are completely non-partisan and do
not support or oppose any political party or issue. We
need volunteers who can give 90-minutes of their time
to help our neighbors get registered for the first time,
confirm their prior registrations, or re-register at their
current address. We are currently recruiting for the
project’s Round 1, running from late June to early July,
for the primary election mail-in registration deadline of
July 9. <i>Information</i>,

received a letter from a twelve-year-old boy
named Bruno. It read: “My dear Pope: I am
undecided. I want to be a policeman or a Pope.
What do you think?” The Pope replied: “My
little Bruno. If you want my opinion, learn how
to be a policeman, because that cannot be
improvised. Anybody can be pope; the proof of
this is that I have become one. If you ever
should be in Rome, come to see me. I would be
glad to talk all this over with you.”</p>
