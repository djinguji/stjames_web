	<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank Cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During October, we made 60
home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions allowed us to keep 44 individuals and
families from being evicted from their homes. We
prevented 13 utility shut offs and provided food to 20
households. In addition, we supplied 30 St. Vincent de
Paul Thrift Store vouchers for beds, furniture, housewares and clothes. Members of the St. Vincent de
Paul Society follow Jesus through service to those in
need. Bearing witness to Christ’s compassionate and
liberating love, we show our commitment through
person-to-person contact, making our home visits in
pairs. As calls for assistance continue to increase, we
actively seek new members. Please consider joining
this deeply rewarding ministry to the poor among us.

Mental Health Ministry devoted to praying for those
living with mental illness and emotional distress. We
