<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from Slater Marshall in
memory of his wife Kathleen, on the first anniversary of
her death.</p>

8:15am, 10:00am (O’Dea High School), 12:10pm, and

welcome to join in all or part of this meditative prayer in
the presence of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament.</p>

the Nightwatch Center three times a month. We need
people to donate food for meals on the first and third
Tuesdays. Items we could use include frozen meat for
the main meal, sandwich meats, sliced cheese, and
condiment packets. Protein is in high demand and short
supply. Please leave your donations marked Operation
Nightwatch in the Cathedral Hall kitchen after Masses
on Sunday, or deliver them to the Parish Office before
4:00 pm on the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays of the month.

<p><b>WINTER SHELTER DONATIONS</b>. Our shelter guests need
disposable razors, lip balm, and cough drops. Please
bring your donations to Cathedral Hall during coffee
hour after Sunday Mass or drop them off at the parish
office Monday to Friday, 9am-5pm.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight,
and the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect
way to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. For those who wish, babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</p>
<p><b>LISTENING ASSISTANCE DEVICES</b>. If you have trouble
hearing the spoken word in the Cathedral, ask an usher
about using one of our listening assistance devices,
which provide clear and clean sound. Not just for the
hard of hearing!</p>

<p><i>Later this year, thanks to some generous parishioners, a permanent

Vatican Council, will be established in the north aisle of the
Cathedral. Throughout the year, keep an eye on this box in the
bulletin to learn more about this great saint of modern times</i>.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/johnxxiii.png" width="133" height="121" align="right">On his mentor, Bishop Radini-Tedeschi of
Bergamo: “He was the polar star of my
priesthood. His soul was more disposed to note
merits than to exaggerate faults. He treated
everybody with the greatest deference. He
spoke with incomparable pleasantness,
seasoning his conversation with unexpected
witticisms. He was not authoritarian. He
wanted all those around him to contribute their
energies to the apostolate
and to assume their proper
responsibilities. He was
discreet. One remarked a
depth of inexhaustible
gaiety in his soul.”</p>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of Holy Redeemer
in Vancouver, and Sacred Heart in LaConner and Winlock.</p>
