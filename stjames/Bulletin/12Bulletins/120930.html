<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>The blessing of the Cathedral’s new shrine in honor of Blessed Pope
John XXIII is a dream come true for me. If you know me at all, you know
that Pope John XXIII occupies a high place in my pantheon of heroes.
What he did for the Church — under the gentle guidance of the Holy Spirit,
of course — can never be overestimated. The Second Vatican Council,
which he called and which got underway fifty years ago next month was,
without a doubt, the most important event in modern Church history (and
by “modern” I’m talking about the past 500 years!).</p>
<p>Most of us who were living at the time of the Council have some
appreciation for its overarching importance. After all, we knew the Church
of our youth — holy and beautiful, but very much turned in on itself. It was
something of a ‘fortress’ Church that in some ways defined its identity in
terms of how different and distinct it was from other Christian churches
and believers — as well as from non-Christians, non-believers, and from the
world itself. Pope John XXIII was himself steeped in the pre-Vatican II
Church, but the Holy Spirit inspired him to see new possibilities and to
seek a path to greater unity. It is said that he opened a window in his
study to symbolize the fresh air he wanted to blow through a stagnant,
self-sufficient Church. And that is exactly what happened at the Second
Vatican Council!</p>
<p>Under his inspired leadership, the bishops of the Catholic world —
along with a large contingent of Protestant leaders and theologians whom
he invited as official observers — came together for prayerful exploration of
the Church and its mission. They studied and debated long-held traditions
and teachings but also listened to the voices of the finest contemporary
theologians and scripture scholars. In addition, the bishops reflected on
modern society itself and on the challenges facing the human family. Pope
John XXIII died shortly after the First Session, but the Council was to
continue for three more years, and from it came a whole series of
documents that affirmed the Catholic tradition but also set forth a fresh
and liberating understanding of it that took the Church a major step
forward. The documents of Vatican II dealt with everything from the way
we pray together, to the way God communicates with us, to our dignity as
baptized believers, to the way bishops collaborate with the Pope in
governing the Church, to issues of religious freedom, to how the Church
should relate to those whose beliefs are different from ours. And much
more!</p>
<p>Pope John XXIII was beatified by Pope John Paul II in the year 2000.
Ever since that time, I have wanted to honor him and his great contribution
to the Church by establishing a permanent shrine in the Cathedral.
Today’s blessing of the shrine (at the 10:00 morning Mass) — coming, as it
does, on the eve of the day fifty years ago when Pope John solemnly
opened the Council — should be a cause of rejoicing for all of us as we give
thanks for this gentle, warm, open-hearted servant of Christ and the gospel
who changed a whole world’s mind about the Catholic Church and
embraced that world with loving arms.</p>
<p>With us at the 10am Mass this morning for the blessing of the new
shrine is retired Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen. And how fitting that
is! Archbishop Hunthausen was named a bishop in 1962 by Pope John
XXIII. Shortly thereafter, he found himself in Rome for the opening of the
Second Vatican Council. Now he has the distinction of being one of a very
few bishops in the world — and the very last American bishop still living —
who participated in all four sessions of the Council! Archbishop Hunthausen 
is fond of saying that he got his ‘on the job training’ to be a
bishop at the Council. To that I would add that, in more ways than I can
count, he embodies the teaching and spirit of the Council. For sixteen
years this archdiocese was blessed by his inspired, humble, courageous,
servant leadership. In so many ways this Archdiocese is what it is today
because of him.</p>
<p>It gives me deep personal joy to welcome back to St. James Cathedral
the archbishop whom I was privileged to work closely with for many years
and who assigned me to St. James as pastor nearly 25 years ago. Welcome
home, Archbishop Hunthausen!</p>
