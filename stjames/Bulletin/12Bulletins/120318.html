<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>SIGN UP TODAY FOR THE LENTEN BLOOD DRIVE</b>. The
blood drive will be on Tuesday, March 20. What could
be a more personal, caring and meaningful gift this
Lenten season than the gift of blood to someone in our
community who has the need? If you have not yet
donated, please consider donating for the first time. If
you have donated in the past, please consider doing so
again. Donor signups will be at the coffee hours after
today’s morning Masses. Or call 206-274-3173.</p>
<p><b>CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES’ OPERATION RICE
BOWL</b>. This week through Operation Rice Bowl, we
learn about our brothers and sisters in Zambia, who are
unable to enter the marketplace and earn a living. We
pray for all who struggle to find work, and we fast for
those who cannot afford to feed their families. We give
so that CRS can help marginalized people obtain loans
in order to save money, start small businesses and
work toward a brighter future.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>PRAYER PARTNERS FOR THE ELECT</b>. Now is the time
to “adopt” one of our Elect as they prepare to celebrate
the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation and
Eucharist. You are asked to pray every day for him/her
asking for God’s blessings and guidance. Notes and
cards will be collected during Holy Week to be given
to the Elect before Easter. Prayer Partner cards are
available at the place of prayer located in the north
aisle of the west nave of the Cathedral where you can
learn more about each of them in our Book of the
Elect. Prayer Partner cards are also located in the
bookstore and in Cathedral Hall during Sunday
morning hospitality. In addition, you can <a href="../../Events/2012/bookoftheelect.htm">meet our Elect</a> 
on our parish website. Your prayers make a difference!

Kennedy made a visit to Pope John XXIII. “It is
reported that in preparation for her visit, John
asked his secretary how he should address her.
The secretary told him he could call her either
‘Mrs. Kennedy’ or ‘Madame.’ The pope tried
the options out loud to decide which seemed
best: ‘Mrs. Kennedy. Madame. Mrs. Kennedy…’
Then the doors were opened
and she was announced. As
she entered, John smiled,
opened his arms wide and
exclaimed ‘Jacqueline!’”<br>

<p><b>MENTAL HEALTH MINISTRY PRAYER PARTNERS</b> are devoted to praying for 
anyone living with mental illness or emotional distress – either in you, a loved 
one, or someone you care for. The Prayer Partners help support the Mental Health 
Ministry by responding to special requests and needs that sometimes can only be 
answered with prayers. You are welcome to submit your requests
<a href="../../Education/mentalhealth.htm">online</a>. </p>
<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight,
and the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect
way to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>PRAYING THE STATIONS</b>. A wonderful Lenten tradition
in the Church. There are three opportunities to pray the
Stations each week: on Mondays following 12:10pm
Midday Prayer, Wednesdays following the 5:30pm
Mass, and Fridays following the 8:15am Mass (except
First Fridays). You can also pray the stations 
<a href="../../Prayer/jkblstations/stations.htm">online</a>.</p>
<p><b>LENTEN HOLY HOURS</b>. Each Friday during Lent, from
12pm – 1pm, we will have a Holy Hour in the
Cathedral, with Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament,
Liturgy of the Hours, rosary, and silence. All are
welcome to join in all or part of this meditative prayer
in the presence of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament.</p>
<p><b>LENTEN ART IN CATHEDRAL CHAPEL</b>. “The Way of the
Cross,” a new art work by local ceramic artists Jessi Li
and George Rodriguez will be in the Cathedral Chapel
throughout Lent.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO</b>. Stop by Cathedral Hall after
the 10:00am Mass today for a latte or mocha. All
proceeds during Lent benefit our RCIA Program.</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. For those who wish, babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially
registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to register</i>.
Registered parishioners receive important mailings
from the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are
regular recipients of the Cathedral’s quarterly journal <i>In
Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate their wedding at the
Cathedral, and their children may attend any of the five
Catholic Rainbow Schools at parishioner rates.
Registration cards can be found in the vestibule. <i>If you
are not sure whether or not you’re registered, call the
Parish Office, 206-622-3559</i>.</p>
