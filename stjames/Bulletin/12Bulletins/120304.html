<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO</b>. Stop by Cathedral Hall after
the 10:00am Mass today for a latte or mocha. All
proceeds during Lent benefit our RCIA Program.</p>
<p><b>LENTEN ART IN CATHEDRAL CHAPEL</b>. “The Way of the
Cross,” a new art work by local ceramic artists Jessi Li
and George Rodriguez will be in the Cathedral Chapel
throughout Lent.</p>
<p><b>OUR ELECT DURING LENT</b>. At our 10:00am Mass you
are seeing our newly Elect wear brown robes while
attending Mass and other liturgies during Lent. This
helps them to know, in a concrete way, that they have
entered a new and significant stage in their final
preparations for Easter. It also anticipates another
change that will take place when they emerge from the
baptismal waters at the Easter Vigil and change to white
robes. Seek them out in our midst and, if possible,
introduce yourself to them after Mass. Let them know
you are praying for them and looking forward to Easter
when they will join us at the Eucharistic table.</p>
<p><b>EXPLORING VATICAN II</b>. Our Lenten series, Keys to the
Council, is underway. It’s not too late to participate in
this program – sessions are on Tuesday evenings at 7pm
OR Saturday mornings at 9am, in Cathedral Place,
Room 1. In addition to the Lenten program, the
Cathedral is proud to offer a series of lectures marking
the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Second
Vatican Council. The first lecture will be on Thursday,
March 15 at 7pm in Cathedral Place Hall – noted
liturgist Paul Janowiak SJ will speak about the Council
and the liturgy. More details can be found on the flyer
in this week’s bulletin. All are welcome!</p>
<p><b>GET INVOLVED IN THE LITURGY!</b> Lent is a good time to
think about sharing your time and talent to make the
liturgy more welcoming and beautiful. At this time we
are especially in need of ushers and greeters at the
Saturday 5:30pm Mass. We are also looking for altar
servers for the 8:00am and 10:00am Masses. Children
may begin to serve after their first Holy Communion.
Please contact

Corinna Laughlin</a>, 206 622-3559, if you are interested in
participating in these or any of our liturgical ministries.</p>

RELIEF SERVICES’ OPERATION RICE BOWL</b>. During
this second week of Lent, we learn
about people in Vietnam who
struggle with disabilities. We pray
that we may recognize the inherent
dignity in all of God’s people, and
we fast so that our sacrifices may bring new life to
others. We give so that CRS can continue to help
people with disabilities receive a quality education and
find productive work.</p>

<p><b>NEW ON THE WEBSITE</b>. Keep up on many 
<a href="../../Events/2012/lent2012.htm">Lenten
activities</a>, prayer opportunities, and special events at the
Cathedral website. You can also read <a href="../../Pubs/Pastor/PastorsDesk.htm">Father Ryan’s

<p dir="ltr"><b>ELECT PRAYER PARTNERS</b>. Now is the time to “adopt”
one of our Elect as they prepare to celebrate the
sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation and
Eucharist. You are asked to pray every day for him/her
asking for God’s blessings and guidance. Notes and
cards will be collected during Holy Week to be given
to the Elect before Easter. Prayer Partner cards are
available at the place of prayer located in the north
aisle of the west nave of the Cathedral where you can
learn more about each of them in our Book of the Elect.
Prayer Partner cards are also located in the bookstore
and in Cathedral Hall during Sunday morning
hospitality. In addition, you can <a href="../../Events/2012/bookoftheelect.htm">meet our Elect</a>

for many years as a Vatican diplomat in
Bulgaria and later in France. He once said: “In
order to be a good diplomat, there are only two
possible solutions: either one must be as mute
as a mole, or garrulous to the
point where one’s proposals lose
importance. Given the fact that I
am an Italian, I prefer the second
method.”</p>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Louise in
Bellevue, and St. Joseph in Seattle, Tacoma, and Lynden.</p>
