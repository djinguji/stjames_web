<p><b>JUSTFAITH</b>. Do you long to lead an extraordinary life of
compassion? Will you help transform the world
through love and service – and be transformed in the
process? The JustFaith program is a small-group
process that offers an opportunity to experience a
spiritual journey into compassionate discipleship.
JustFaith provides a lively and challenging format to
engage and be formed by our Catholic faith tradition
that changes lives, inspires compassionate witness and
transforms the world through modeling the love and
justice of God in Jesus Christ. The program includes
readings, videos, conversations about the most difficult
topics, face-to-face encounters with the poor, and an
investigation into the intersection of spirituality and
Christian activism. Come learn more at the Information
Night, Monday, July 9 at 6:30pm in the Pastoral
Outreach Center. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND/OR BECOMING
CATHOLIC?</b> You are invited to participate in the RCIA,
a process of initiation into the Catholic community of
faith. It is a process which encompasses the study of
Scripture, Catholic teaching, and Christian values—the
development and deepening of a life of prayer and
action—all with the support and involvement of the
parish community. You can learn more by going to
the <a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA">RCIA

session will begin Wednesday, July 11 at 7:00 pm in

<p><b>ON THE NEXT SENIOR TRIP</b>, Wednesday July 11, you
might be peering out of the tram at bellowing bison less
than 10 feet away or standing nose-to-nose with an
otter: both common wildlife encounters at Northwest
Trek. Join us and enjoy the wildlife, the lush landscape,
and the company of God’s people! Space is limited and
priority will be given to registered parishioners over the
age of 65! <i>Information</i>, or to reserve your place,

<p><b>LIVING SOLIDARITY</b>. The Gospel and Catholic Social
Teaching remind us that we are responsible for both
ourselves and the common good. One of the ways in
which we do this is through government, taxes and the
federal budget. What kind of society do we wish to
have? It is vital that all of us engage this question by
bringing our values–not our opinions—to the many
conversations about the economy and the federal
budget. Being informed about and engaged with these
issues is part of our responsibility as citizens and as
people of faith. <i>Living Solidarity: Government, the
Federal Budget and the Common Good</i> is an 8-week
exploration of these issues, including reading and small
group dialogue. Thursday evenings, July 12 through
August 30. Registration required. <i>Information</i>, or to
register,

Bowman</a>, 206-382-4515.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight,
and the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect
way to end a busy week. During Camino Seattle, music
from the Camino will be featured each week.</p>
