<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS ON THE ALTAR</b> are in loving memory of
David Pettigrew from his family. <i>If you would like to offer flowers, contact

<p><b>THE NEXT SENIOR TRIP</b>, Wednesday, September 12,
will take us to the Point Defiance Zoo. This zoo is large
enough to offer a wide array of animals yet small
enough to let you get really close to them. You'll see
seahorses and sharks, peacocks and penguins, wolves
and walrus, all in one place. It offers beautiful views of
Puget Sound, Mount Rainier and the Olympic
Mountains too. Space is limited and priority will be
given to registered parishioners! <i>Information, or to
