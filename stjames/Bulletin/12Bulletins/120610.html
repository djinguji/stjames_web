<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from Seattle University
in honor of the Class of 2012, and from the
Archdiocese of Seattle in thanksgiving for our newly
ordained priest, Jose Alvarez.</p>
<p><b>CELEBRATE ST. JAMES IN SONG</b>. Everyone is
welcome to participate in our annual All-Parish Choir
Sunday, at the 10:00am Mass, June 17—high voices,
low voices; “trained” voices, untrained voices, very
young, very old, family groups and singles, those who
sing in tune, and those who sing in some other tune.
Music is easy and exciting, the rehearsal is fun, the
chance to celebrate St. James Parish is huge.
Rehearsals Thursday, June 14, 7:30pm and Sunday,
June 17, 9:05am in the Cathedral. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>THE JUNE SENIOR TRIP</b> will take place on Wednesday,
June 13. We will visit the newly opened LeMay-America’s Car Museum. It is a gleaming tribute to how
the automobile has shaped American culture and society.
Did you ever sit in a car and watch a drive-in movie? Do
you remember the model your grandfather drove? What
was your own first vehicle? Chances are they’re in the
collection! Please join us as we travel down memory
lane! Space is limited and priority will be given to
registered parishioners. <i>Information, or to reserve your
place</i>,

<p><b>HELP A NEIGHBOR IN NEED</b>. Many of our neighbors
need help with transportation, shopping, laundry, and
housework. Advanced age, chronic illness and
financial difficulties can keep them from
accomplishing these routine daily tasks on their own.
By volunteering just a few hours a month with
Volunteer Chore Services, you can help someone in
our community continue living at own home and avoid
moving to an institutional setting. Find out more about
VCS by attending a brief informational session
Sunday, June 10 from 11:15 to 11:45 am in the
Mother Mary Rose Room of the Pastoral Outreach
Center (907 Columbia). <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST. JAMES VOTER REGISTRATION PROJECT 2012</b>.
Some graduates of the St. James JustFaith class of 2009 are responding to the 
call of Catholic Social Teaching to promote participation in civic life by 
helping people in the cathedral neighborhood, particularly the poor and 
homeless, register to vote during this presidential election year. We are 
completely non-partisan and do not support or oppose any political party or 
issue. We need volunteers who can give 90-minutes of their time to help our 
neighbors get registered for the first time, confirm their prior registrations, 
or re-register at their current address. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During May we made a total of
57 home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions helped us to keep 37 individuals and
families in their homes, and to prevent 6 utility shutoffs.
We provided food for 17 households and clothes
for 4 people. We also gave out 11 vouchers for beds
and furniture, and helped 6 people with transportation
costs. Helping our neighbors pay their rent cost us an
average of $3.90 per bed night. This is far cheaper than
picking up the pieces after people lose their homes.
Shelters cost $15-$20 per night, and motels cost $50 or
more. Members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society
follow Jesus through service to those in need. We show
our commitment through person-to-person contact,
always making our home visits in pairs. Please consider
joining our ministry to the poor among us. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>IS HOSPITALITY YOUR GIFT?</b> We are looking for a
“few good people” to assist in setting up, greeting
participants, and putting things away for our weekly RCIA gathering. The time commitment is once a
month from 6:00-9:30pm. It is a great way to meet
new people and support an important parish
ministry. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>INTRODUCING… CAMINO SEATTLE!</b> This summer, in
the weeks leading up to the Feast of St. James, the
whole parish community is invited to embark on a five-week walking and prayer 
adventure called <i>Camino Seattle</i>. You’re invited to create your own 
walking and prayer goal and set out on “pilgrimage” on June 24. Participants 
will receive a passport, which you can fill with stamps each week during the 
Camino. All are welcome—why not get a friend to walk with you? Visit the <a href="../../camino/caminomain.htm"><i>Camino Seattle</i> 
webpage</a> for more
information. Sign ups will be next Sunday, June 17
after all Masses.</p>
<p><b>WILL YOU ASSIST A PERSON WHO WANTS TO
BECOME CATHOLIC?</b> We continue to have new
inquirers coming to participate in our Christian
Initiation process to learn more about the Catholic
Church (RCIA). We need St. James parishioners to be
companions with our new inquirers to help welcome
them to our community. The time commitment is
reasonable – two Wednesday evening sessions a
month. Training and support are provided. The
rewards are many, including renewal and update of
your own faith and “kudos” in heaven. <i>Information</i>,

	<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of Blessed
Sacrament in Seattle and St. Anthony in Renton, and the
mission church of St. Anthony in Carnation.</p>
