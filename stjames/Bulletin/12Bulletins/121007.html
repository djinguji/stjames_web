		<p><img border="0" src="../../images/johnxxiii.png" width="133" height="121" align="right">Pope John XXIII died on June 3, 1963. In his last
days, he told those gathered around him: “This
bed is an altar. The altar demands a victim. I am
ready. I have before me a clear view of my soul,
of my priesthood, of the Council, of the
Universal Church… Come, courage! This is not
the moment to weep; this is a moment of joy
and glory.” To one person he said, “Don’t be
disturbed. My bags are always packed. When
the moment comes to depart, I won’t lose any
time.” And to his longtime secretary, he said,
“When it’s all over, don’t forget to go visit your
mother.” His last words were “<i>Mater mei, fiducia
mea</i>”—”My Mother, my trust.”</p>
