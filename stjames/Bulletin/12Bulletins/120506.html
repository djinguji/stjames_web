<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>GUEST CHOIR SATURDAY 5:30PM</b>. We welcome Bel
Canto, the youth choir of First Presbyterian Church of
Bellevue. Scott Dean, Director.</p>
<p><b>MAY IS MENTAL HEALTH MONTH</b>. One in every five
Americans experiences a mental disorder in any given
year. Mental illnesses are far more common than cancer,
diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis. People living with
mental health problems are our neighbors; members of
our parishes; members of our families. Mental Health
Ministry offers two special events this month: <b>Today,
May 6</b>: Informational MHM Table at all coffee hours.
There will be brochures and information available, and
volunteers standing by to answer questions about mental
health or the ministry. <b>Tuesday, May 22</b>: Information
Night, 6:30-8:30pm. Learn about stigma and myths
related to mental illness. Gain more in-depth knowledge
about mental health and illness. Hear personal stories of
living with mental illness. <i>To register or for more
information</i>,

<p><b>ARE YOU A CATHOLIC WHO HAS BEEN AWAY FROM
THE CHURCH?</b> Our Welcome Back program provides a safe place, in the company

to regular church attendance and the sacraments, and to learn about changes in 
the church. It’s not too late to join! The sessions began Monday, April 23 and 
continue through July 16, 7:00-9:00pm on 2nd floor Cathedral Place. Classes are 
offered without any obligation.

inquirers to help welcome them to our community. The time commitment is

<p><i>Later this year, thanks to some generous parishioners, a permanent
shrine to Blessed John XXIII, the Pope who called the Second
Vatican Council, will be established in the north aisle of the
Cathedral. Throughout the year, keep an eye on this box in the
bulletin to learn more about this great saint of modern times</i>.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/johnxxiii.png" width="133" height="121" align="right">During a visit to the Regina Coeli prison in
Rome, the Pope requested that the inmates be
allowed to leave their cells so that he might
address them in the main courtyard of the
prison. “I have come,” he said, “you have seen
me. I have looked into your eyes, I have placed
my heart alongside your hearts.” Among the
prisoners who were allowed to approach the
Pope, there were two murderers. One of them,
after kissing the Pontiff’s ring, looked up at him
with deep sadness on his face. “Are those
words of hope you have given us meant for
such a great sinner as I
am?” In response the Pope
bent over the convict and
embraced him.</p>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parish of St. Brendan in
Bothell and the Mission Church of St. Yves in Harmony.</p>
