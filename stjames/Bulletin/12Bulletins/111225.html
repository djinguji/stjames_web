<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Along with our Archbishop, Most Reverend J. Peter Sartain, I welcome you to 
St. James Cathedral on this great feast of Christmas.</p>
<p>For many of you, St. James Cathedral is your home. You are a member of this 
large and wonderfully diverse parish. For others of you, Christmas at St. James 
is a long and cherished tradition; still other will be coming here for the first 
time. You are all welcome. And I hope you will discover in this holy place what 
people have always discovered at St. James: a great cathedral alive with the 
presence of God and a vibrant community of people who not only pray together in 
this place, but also carry out an impressive and almost dizzying array of 
outreach ministries to the poor and needy of our city.</p>
<p>I never cease to marvel at how many people find a home here at St. James 
Cathedral and how many meet Jesus in this place. They meet him in the Eucharist 
that is celebrated here, in the Word that is preached here, in the community 
that gathers here and, in a most rewarding way, they meet him in the poor people 
who have always found a home here—maybe the only place they can really call 
home.</p>
<p>Week after week, the thousands of people who gather here to pray leave this 
beautiful place to go out and live their Christian faith. In welcoming you here 
today, I invite you to consider becoming a part of this wonderful community, 
part of the life and mission of St. James Cathedral by joining us for Mass each 
weekend and by involving yourself in one of the many ministries and activities 
that are the hallmark of this place. The pages which immediately follow in this 
booklet will give you some idea of what goes on at St. James Cathedral the other 
364 days of the year.</p>
<p>Every Christmas we celebrate the wondrous mystery of a God who found a home 
among us poor humans, a home in our own flesh and blood. Ever since that 
world-changing moment, Christmas has been not only a moment in time, an event in 
the far-distant past, but a present event and a constantly unfolding mystery. 
What happened in a lowly stable in Bethlehem two thousand years ago happens over 
and over again in our time as we open our lives, our heats, and our homes to the 
God whose delight is to dwell among the members of the human family.</p>
<p>May you and all your loved ones be touched by the great Mystery we celebrate 
this day; may the thousands of people throughout the region who will experience 
the Midnight Mass on KING 5 Television be uplifted by our prayer, and may the 
blessings of Christmas—deep peace, abiding love, and overflowing joy—by yours in 
abundance.</p>

and its Archbishop, the Most Reverend J. Peter Sartain. We are also a parish 
church for a vibrant faith community with a long history that reaches back to 
Seattle's early days.</p>
<p>We are an inner-city parish with an outreach to many who live on the edge of 
poverty and loneliness. We are a diverse community that welcomes, accepts, and 
celebrates the differences we all bring. We exist in the heart of the city, yet 
sometimes our parishioners come from considerable distances to worship here. </p>
<p>St. James Cathedral is a crossroads where ideas and challenges both old and 
new are explored in the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Our Cathedral is 
also the center for many cultural and ecumenical events where both reflect and 
help to shape a vital metropolitan community.</p>
<p>Above all, St. James Cathedral is a community of prayer.</p>
