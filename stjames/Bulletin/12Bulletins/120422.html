<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>GUEST CHOIRS, SATURDAY 5:30PM MASS</b>. We
welcome two ensembles from the Forest Ridge School
of the Sacred Heart: The choir is directed by Alison
Seaton; the bell ringers are directed by Ron Mallory.</p>
<p><b>NEW ON THE WEBSITE</b>. Visit the website to read 
<a href="../../Pubs/Pastor/2012/12april15.htm">Father Ryan’s homily for last
Sunday</a> online. You can also view <a href="../../Events/2012/album-triduum.htm">photo albums</a> of

6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight,

	<p><b>OUR VATICAN II LECTURE SERIES CONTINUES: VATICAN II AND SCRIPTURE</b>. Father James Eblen,
noted Scripture scholar and priest of the Archdiocese
of Seattle, will give the second in our Vatican II
Lecture Series on Monday, April 30 at 7:00pm in
Cathedral Place Hall. Father Eblen will explore the
Council’s seminal document on Scripture and
revelation, <i>Dei Verbum</i>. “Such force and power are
present in the word of God that it remains the
Church’s support and source of energy, and for her
children a strengthening of the faith, a food of the
soul, and never failing source of spiritual life… For
Christ’s faithful the approach to holy Scripture should
lie wide open.” (<i>Dei Verbum</i>)</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND/OR BECOMING
CATHOLIC?</b> You are invited to participate in the RCIA, a process of 
initiation into the Catholic community of faith. It is a process which 
encompasses the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching, and Christian values—the 
development and deepening of a life of prayer and action—all with the support 
and involvement of the parish community. You can learn more by going to the <a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA">RCIA website</a>. 
A new inquiry session will begin Wednesday, April 25 at 7:00 pm in Cathedral 
Place, second floor. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ARE YOU A CATHOLIC WHO HAS BEEN AWAY FROM
THE CHURCH?</b> Our Welcome Back program provides
a safe place, in the company of others who are also
examining their faith, to ask questions about returning
to regular church attendance, returning to the
sacraments, and to learn about changes in the church.
The sessions are offered on Mondays, April 23 through
July 16, 7:00-9:00pm on 2nd floor Cathedral
Place. Classes are offered without any obligation.

<p><b>WOULD YOU CONSIDER ASSISTING A PERSON</b> who
wants to become Catholic? We continue to have new
inquirers coming to participate in our Christian
Initiation process to learn more about the Catholic
Church (RCIA). We need St. James parishioners to be
companions with our new inquirers to help welcome
them to our community. The time commitment is
reasonable – two Wednesday evening sessions a
month. Training and support are provided. The
rewards are many, including renewal and update of
your own faith and “kudos” in heaven. <i>Information</i>,

<p><i>Later this year, thanks to some generous parishioners, a permanent

Vatican Council, will be established in the north aisle of the
Cathedral. Throughout the year, keep an eye on this box in the

<p><img border="0" src="../../images/johnxxiii.png" width="133" height="121" align="right">John XXIII recounted that in the first months of
his pontificate, he often awoke during the night,
thinking himself still a cardinal and worried
over a difficult decision to be made. At these
times, he would say to himself, “I’ll talk it over
with the Pope.” Then he would remember
where he was. “But <i>I’m</i> the Pope!” he would
say to himself. After which he
would conclude: “Well, I’ll talk it
over with Our Lord!”</p>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we

Seattle and St. Catherine Mission in Cathlamet and Concrete.</p>
