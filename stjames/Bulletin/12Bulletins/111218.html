<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>NEW IN THE BOOKSTORE</b>. Cathedral Christmas Cards
are still available—but going fast! We also have some
wonderful new Christmas books for children.
<i>Cathedral Music CDs make the perfect stocking stuffer!
Please note that the Cathedral Bookstore will be closed
the next two weekends in observance of the Christmas
and New Year’s Day holidays</i>.</p>
<p><b>OUR ST. JAMES “WARM HEARTS AND SOLES”</b> 8th
annual Advent sock drive for homeless men continues
today, December 18. Your generosity is warming our
hearts–we are doing well, but a little short of our goal
of 2011 pairs for delivery in January to warm the soles
of those in need. Advent is coming to a close, but let’s
keep up our efforts by dropping off new socks at the
sock collection table in Cathedral Hall after 8:00am,
10:00am, and 12:00 Sunday Masses—AND you can
continue to drop off sock donations during the week at
2nd floor Cathedral Place. Such a worthwhile project—let’s keep those hearts and soles warm this winter!

<p><b>ADVENT COMMUNAL PENANCE SERVICE</b> will be held
on Monday, December 19 at 7:30pm. During this
beautiful service of readings, reflection and song, we
will open ourselves to experience the gift of God’s
gracious and loving forgiveness in the Sacrament of
Penance. It has long been a tradition in the church to
confess one’s sins before celebrating the great feast of
Christmas. This will be the ideal time to do so.</p>
<p><b>THE SOLEMNITY OF THE DEDICATION OF ST. JAMES
CATHEDRAL</b>. St. James Cathedral was dedicated by
Bishop Edward O’Dea on December 22, 1907, and
rededicated by Archbishop Thomas J. Murphy on
December 22, 1994. Each year, the Cathedral’s
anniversary of dedication is celebrated throughout the
Archdiocese. The solemn celebration of this special day
will be at the 5:30pm Mass on Monday, December 21.
The Mass begins with a special procession to light the
dedication candles. All are welcome.</p>
<p><b>CHRISTMAS IS ON A SUNDAY THIS YEAR</b>. Did you
know that when Christmas falls on a Sunday, it has a
major impact on our parish budget? Because we lose a
weekend collection, we anticipate a loss of around
$25,000 this year. Would you consider making your
usual Sunday offering in addition to your Christmas
offering next week? Two envelopes were provided for
this purpose in your December packet. It will make a
big difference!</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND/OR BECOMING
CATHOLIC?</b> You are invited to participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the Catholic
community of faith. It is a process which encompasses
the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching, and Christian
values—the development and deepening of a life of
prayer and action—all with the support and
involvement of the parish community. You can learn more by going to
the <a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA">RCIA website</a>. A
new inquiry session will begin Wednesday, January 11
at 7:00pm in Cathedral Place, second floor.

	<p><b>UPCOMING CONCERTS</b>. Portland-based Cappella Romana performs Rachmaninoff’s All Night Vigil on
Saturday, January 7, 8:00 pm; information 503-927-9027. And Cathedral Resident Ensemble
PacificMusicWorks presents Prophets, a staged,
costumed, and evocatively lit evening of sung retellings
of the Hebrew hero stories—Abraham and Isaac, Job,
Jeptha, and The Denial of St. Peter, with the music of
Baroque masters, Carissimi and Charpentier on January
13 and 14 at 8:00pm. <i>Information</i>

	<p><b>WHAT ARE HOLIDAY BLUES?</b> The holidays are
supposed to be a joyful time of good cheer. Yet, it is
not unusual for many of us to feel sad or lonely during
the holiday period—a condition that has come to be
called “holiday blues” or “holiday depression.” For
more information, visit the <a href="../../Education/mentalhealth.htm">Mental 
	Health Ministry</a> page.</p>
<p><b>CONFIRMATION CLASSES FOR ADULTS AND HIGH
SCHOOL STUDENTS</b> 16 years and older begin
Thursday, February 16, 6:30-8:30 pm in Cathedral
Place Room 411. Full sacramental initiation (Baptism,
Confirmation, and Eucharist) is important for all
practicing Catholics, and is particularly important for
those who are considering getting married.

	<p><b>WOULD YOU CONSIDER ASSISTING A PERSON</b> who
wants to become Catholic? We continue to have new
inquirers coming to participate in our Christian
Initiation process to learn more about the Catholic
Church (RCIA). We need St. James parishioners to be
companions with our new inquirers to help welcome
them to our community. The time commitment is
reasonable–two Wednesday evening sessions a
month. Training and support are provided. The
rewards are many, including renewal and update of
your faith and “kudos” in heaven. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN</b> is looking for volunteers
who might be interested in joining our Tuesday crew.
Since two of our team members will be leaving us

willing to come in around 3:30pm and be the pots and
pans dishwasher (scrubber) and a second volunteer to

5:45pm. Aside from these specific requests we are
always looking for those who would work as part of the
Monday through Friday crew to sweep and mop the
dining hall. This activity begins at 4:45pm or so and
