<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from an anonymous
donor in gratitude for our Filipino parishioners and all
the blessings and gifts they bring to the St. James
Cathedral parish community.</p>
<p><b>SPIRIT OF PROPHECY ART EXHIBIT IN THE CHAPEL</b>.
Through February 19, our Cathedral Chapel is host to a
special exhibit entitled “The Spirit of Prophecy,”
featuring works by five contemporary artists. Each of
the artists is known for addressing spiritual themes in
works which range from large-scale oils to intimate
woodcuts and mixed media sculpture. A short tour of
the exhibit will be offered immediately following the
Sunday 10:00am Mass and Sunday 5:30pm Masses this
weekend. Simply gather in the Chapel.</p>

<p><b>THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU</b> to our generous
parishioners who contributed 2,735 pairs of socks to
our 2011 Advent Warm Hearts and Soles sock drive to
benefit the homeless in our city. We thank our
individual donors as well as our generous corporate
donor, the Zumiez Foundation, for helping us exceed
our goal. In addition to the men’s socks we received
some for women and children, and also some hats,
gloves, and jackets. All are going to organizations we
work with to be distributed to those in need. And many
thanks, too, to our friends who donated their time to
collect socks following the Advent Masses. We are
blessed to have such a caring and generous parish!</p>
<p><b>WOULD YOU CONSIDER ASSISTING A PERSON</b> who
wants to become Catholic? We continue to have new
inquirers coming to participate in our Christian
Initiation process to learn more about the Catholic
Church (RCIA). We need St. James parishioners to be
companions with our new inquirers to help welcome
them to our community. The time commitment is
reasonable–two Wednesday evening sessions a
month. Training and support are provided. The
rewards are many, including renewal and update of
your faith and “kudos” in heaven. <i>Information</i>,

<p><i>Later this year, thanks to some generous parishioners, a permanent

Vatican Council, will be established in the north aisle of the
Cathedral. Throughout the year, keep an eye on this box in the

<p><img border="0" src="../../images/johnxxiii.png" width="133" height="121" align="right">Angelo’s first memory of childhood was of a
pilgrimage to a local shrine, the Madonna delle
Caneve. By the time his pregnant mother arrived
at the shrine on foot, carrying her two youngest
and leading the other three, aged 4, 5, and 6, the
church was full and they could not get inside. But
that did not deter Marianna, who lifted the
children up one after the other to look through the
window. “My mother lifted me up,”
Angelo recalled, “and said, ‘Look,
Angelino, look how beautiful the
Madonna is. I have consecrated you
wholly to her.’”</p>

are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass

week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Mary in
Aberdeen, Seattle, and Seaview; St. Mary Mission in
Coupeville; and Sacred Heart in Battle Ground and
Enumclaw.</p>
