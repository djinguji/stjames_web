<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>CONFIRMATION CLASSES FOR ADULTS AND HIGH
SCHOOL STUDENTS</b> 16 years and older begin

Place Room 411. Full sacramental initiation (Baptism,
Confirmation, and Eucharist) is important for all
practicing Catholics, and is particularly important for
those who are considering getting married.

Joseph and St. Therese Catholic Schools will be
available following the 10:00am and Noon Masses

sending their elementary school aged children to any
one of the Rainbow Schools. <i>Information</i>,
