<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James is
proud to welcome visitors from near and far
throughout the summer months. Each week a
drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be made from
among all the visitor envelopes used. Please write your
address on the visitor envelope provided in the pew and
drop it with your offering into the collection basket.
Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer by your
presence in our midst today. You are most welcome in this
holy place! <b>Last week, we had visitors from 
Ridley Park, PA;
Crystal Lake, IL; Dhaka, Bangladesh, and many
other places. The winner of our drawing was from
St. John, IN.
</b></i></p>
<p><b>SUMMER CHOIR</b>. Come one, come all to support the
musical prayer of the assembly at 12:00 Noon Mass
each Sunday of August. There is a rehearsal in the
Cathedral Choir Room at 11:15am on Sundays before
the Mass.</p>
<p><b>TEACHER BLESSING AT THE NOON MASS</b>. Thank you
for your presence today as we recognize and bless
Catholics who teach in public and non-Catholic private
schools, colleges, and universities and act as “witnesses
of the faith” Please come to the reception in the
courtyard and hall after Mass. If you are an educator
interested in receiving information and resources from
the Office of Catholic Faith Formation, please provide
your contact information on the sign-up sheets at the
reception.</p>
<p><b>SUMMER FILM FESTIVAL</b>. Join us on Tuesday, August
21 for our 3rd Summer Film Festival offerings. We are
delighted to offer a fun and uplifting musical film,
<i>Joyful Noise</i>, starring Queen Latifah and Dolly
Parton. Let’s see what happens when two strong-minded
women are forced to cooperate when budget
cuts threaten to shut down a small-town choir. The film
will be shown in Cathedral Place, 2nd floor at 7:00pm.
Popcorn and lemonade will be provided and you are
welcome to bring your favorite movie treats.

<p><b>CHILDREN’S FAITH FORMATION</b>. We need parishioners
who are willing to commit an hour and a half of their
Sunday mornings to assist in the Children’s Faith

<p><b>PRAYER WITH MUSIC FROM TAIZÉ</b>. Each Friday at
6:30pm in the Cathedral, all are invited to join in an
ecumenical service of readings, silence, candlelight,
and the music of the ecumenical community of Taizé in
France. This simple, reflective prayer is the perfect
way to end a busy week.</p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN</b> is looking for three new
gleaners. The commitment is one morning a week.
Each morning, two volunteers take the Cathedral van
and go to three PCC Markets and the Madison Market,
to collect and sort produce, dairy, deli, and dry goods.
These donated food items are used in our daily meal.
The food that we are unable to use at the Cathedral
Kitchen is passed on to St. Mary’s Food Bank. Nothing
goes to waste! If you would like to become involved in
this outreach, contact

	<p dir="ltr"><b>HELP FEED THE HUNGRY</b>. Several times every month,
teams of St. James parishioners cook and serve dinner
for 150-170 homeless people at the Operation Nightwatch Center near Seattle University. We urgently
need a volunteer to prepare dinner once a month—on
either the 1st or the 3rd Tuesday from 5:00 to 8:30 pm.
During October, one of our longtime cooks will be on
vacation, so we will be in special need of assistance.
Please consider joining this deeply rewarding ministry.

<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. For those who wish, babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</p>
<p><b>ARE YOU A REGISTERED PARISHIONER AT ST.
JAMES?</b> Many who attend St. James regularly and
consider the Cathedral their parish have never officially
registered. <i>We strongly encourage you to register</i>.
Registered parishioners receive important mailings
from the Cathedral (including offering envelopes!), are
regular recipients of the Cathedral’s quarterly journal <i>In
Your Midst</i>, are able to celebrate their wedding at the
Cathedral, and their children may attend any of the five
Catholic Rainbow Schools at parishioner rates.
Registration cards can be found in the vestibule. <i>If you
are not sure whether or not you’re registered, call the
Parish Office, 206-622-3559</i>.</p>

	<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the

week we remember in prayer the parishes of Mary, Queen of
Peace in Sammamish, Queen of Heaven in Tacoma, and
