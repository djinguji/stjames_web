<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO</b>. Stop by Cathedral Hall after
the 10:00am Mass today for a latte or mocha. All
proceeds in the month of December support our parish’s
Pregnancy Support Ministry.</p>
<p><b>ADVENT BAZAAR TODAY</b>. Stop by our annual Advent
Bazaar in Cathedral Hall after the morning Masses.
Vendors include Jubilee Traders, the L’Arche
community, and Catholic Relief Services Work of
Human Hands. This is a great opportunity to find
alternative gifts from fair trade sellers. <i>A Cathedral
Advent calendar is free with every purchase</i>!</p>
<p><b>NEW IN THE BOOKSTORE</b>. Celebrate Advent with good
spiritual reading for the season. Also in stock: Cathedral
Christmas Cards!</p>
<p><b>OUR ST. JAMES “WARM HEARTS AND SOLES”</b> 8th
annual Advent sock drive for homeless men continues
today, Sunday, December 4. Your generosity is
warming our hearts as we collect socks toward our goal
of 2011 pairs for delivery in January to warm the soles
of those in need. Advent will be over before we know it,
so let’s keep up our efforts by dropping off new socks at
coffee hour in Cathedral Hall after 8:00am, 10:00am,
and 12:00 Noon Sunday Masses, or during the week at
2nd floor Cathedral Place. Such a worthwhile project–let’s keep those hearts and soles warm this
winter! <i>Information</i>

requests to God</i> (<i>Phil 4:6</i>). We are a branch of the new
Mental Health Ministry devoted to praying for those
living with mental illness and emotional distress. We
support the Mental Health Ministry by responding to
special requests and needs that sometimes can only be
answered with prayers. If you would like to request
prayers for yourself, a loved one, or someone you care
for go to
<a href="../../Education/mentalhealth.htm">Mental Health Ministry</a> webpage and submit
your prayer requests. All requests are strictly
confidential.</p>
<p><b>THE FOOD BANK AT ST. MARY’S</b> thanks all of the
parishioners at St. James who contributed canned and
dry goods on Thanksgiving Day. It was an
overabundance of generosity and was very much
appreciated by many in need.</p>
