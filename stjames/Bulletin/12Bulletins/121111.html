<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During October we made 65
home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions allowed us to help 41 individuals and
families pay their rent and stay safely in their homes. In
addition, we prevented 5 utility shut-offs, provided food
for 17 families, beds and furniture for 3 households,
clothes for 2 people, and transportation assistance for 5
individuals. Our priority is preventing homelessness.
This makes your contributions go a long way. Helping
our neighbors pay their rent is far cheaper than picking
up the pieces after they lose their homes. Members of
the St. Vincent de Paul Society follow Jesus through
service to those in need. Bearing witness to Christ’s
compassionate and liberating love, we show our
commitment through person-to-person contact, making
our home visits in pairs. Please consider joining our
ministry to the poor among us. <i>Information</i>, Rob Millar

<p><b>MEET OTHER PARISHIONERS</b>. Join with hundreds of St.
James parishioners in our parish’s upcoming production

who can volunteer a couple of hours or a couple of
weeks and everything in between. We need costume
sewers, stage crew, lighting assistants, office support,
etc. This is a great way to get to know other
parishioners and make new friendships. <i>Information</i>,
