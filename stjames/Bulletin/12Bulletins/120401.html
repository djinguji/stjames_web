<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>LENTEN PRAYER PARTNERS FOR THE ELECT</b>. The
Church tells us that it is the entire parish’s
responsibility to support and welcome those preparing
for baptism this Easter. Notes and cards will be
collected during Holy Week to be given to the Elect
before Easter. Please consider writing a note of
support and welcome to one or all of our Elect. (You
can “meet” them by viewing the Book of the Elect in
the Cathedral or on our <a href="../../Events/2012/bookoftheelect.htm">parish 
website</a>.) Notes, cards, and gifts may be left at the parish office during 
the week, or dropped in the special bin in the north aisle beginning on Holy 
Thursday.

<p><b>CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES’ OPERATION RICE BOWL</b>. As we reflect on the passion of Christ, we
remember that more than 44 million people in the
United States are living in poverty. While 75% of our
gifts to Operation Rice Bowl support Catholic Relief
Services’ programs in other nations, 25% of our
contributions remain in our diocese to support local
hunger and poverty alleviation efforts. Your prayers,
fasting, learning, and almsgiving through Operation
Rice Bowl make a significant difference in the lives of
people in our own community and in communities
around the world. <i>Be sure to bring your Rice Bowls to
the Evening Mass of the Lord’s Supper on Holy
Thursday</i>.</p>
<p><b>YOUNG ADULT PILGRIMAGE</b>. All young adults, ages
18-30, are invited to join Archbishop Sartain on April
5 on a Holy Thursday pilgrimage to pray before the
Blessed Sacrament in several churches on Capitol Hill
and downtown. The pilgrimage will begin
immediately following the 6:00pm Evening Mass of
the Lord’s Supper at the Cathedral on April 5, and will
conclude back at the Cathedral shortly before
Midnight. For more information, contact Bridget
Harris in the Office of Youth and Young Adult
Ministry of the Archdiocese of Seattle, 206-274-3175,
or just join the Archbishop on the steps at the west
entrance of the Cathedral following the Holy Thursday
Mass.</p>
<p><b>LENTEN BLOOD DRIVE THANK YOU</b>. 34 donors
registered for the Lenten Blood Drive on March 20, for
a total potential benefit of up to 72 different patients.
This is a powerful support for our community and is
greatly appreciated by patients and their families,
friends, and care providers. The Puget Sound Blood
Center and the St. James Health and Healing Ministry
extend a grateful thank you to all who participated.</p>
<p><b>THE FIRST SENIOR TRIP</b> will be Wednesday, April 18.
First we will visit the Seattle Aquarium and its
mammoth, 120,000-gallon exhibit. Experience a
glimpse into life under the surface of Puget Sound and
see salmon, rockfish, lingcod, wolf eels, sea otters,
sharks and more! Our second stop will be the Boehm
Chocolate Factory. Observe the making of the most
exquisite, European style, hand-dipped chocolates to
classic American Fudge. Please join us for a tour and a
taste! Space is limited and priority will be given to
registered parishioners over 65. <i>Information, or to

4, 1958, John XXIII recalled a time in his childhood
when he was carried on his father’s shoulders:

sons. More than seventy years ago I
was carried on the shoulders of my
father at Ponte San Pietro. The secret
