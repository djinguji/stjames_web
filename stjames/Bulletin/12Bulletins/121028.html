XXIII to offer a prayer to this great saint of modern times.</i></p>
<p>The poverty of the Church was one of the
recurring themes of his pontificate. John XXIII
wanted the poor to feel at ease in the Church of
Jesus Christ, the poorest of the poor, and he
constantly encouraged the Fathers of the Council
to take steps in this direction. In his address of
September 11, 1962, he took pleasure in quoting
this passage of St. Peter in the Acts of the
Apostles: “I have neither gold nor silver, but
what I have I give to you.”</p>
