<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>
<p><b>NEW ON THE WEBSITE</b>. View photo albums of recent
events in the Cathedral, including last Saturday’s 
<a href="../../Events/2012/album-mlk.htm">Mass in
celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr</a>. You can also read
or listen to <a href="../../Pubs/Pastor/2012/12jan22.htm">Father Ryan’s homily of last Sunday</a> online.
Also: we are conducting a 
<a target="_bulletin" class="navy" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CJSS6RQ">simple survey on the new
Roman Missal</a>. An e-mail went out to our parish list last
week. If you didn’t get it, please visit the Cathedral
website to complete this brief survey. </p>
<p><b>WILL YOU BE A “SNOW ANGEL”?</b> Due to the snow
storm January 15, our Sunday collection was down by
$11,300 (compared to the same week in 2011). If you
missed Mass, would you consider making your usual
Sunday and St. Vincent de Paul offering for that Sunday
this week? That will help us make our budget!</p>
<p><b>BLESSING OF CANDLES</b>. On Thursday, February 2, we
celebrate the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord, with
the traditional blessing of candles for use in the Cathedral
throughout the coming year at the 8:15am and 5:30pm
Masses. You are welcome to bring your own candles
from home for the blessing.</p>
<p><b>BLESSING OF THROATS</b>. Friday, February 3 is the Feast
of Saint Blaise, bishop and martyr. According to legend,
Saint Blaise saved a boy who was choking. He is the
patron saint of all with throat ailments and diseases. The
traditional blessing of throats will take place in the
context of the Masses at 8:15am and 5:30pm. All are
welcome.</p>
<p><b>FIRST FRIDAY EXPOSITION AND HOLY HOUR</b>. On
Friday, February 3, Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament
will begin immediately following the 8:15am Mass and
continue until 1:00pm, with Holy Hour, including
hymns, readings, and rosary, beginning at 12 Noon.</p>
<p><b>YOUTH MUSIC FESTIVAL</b>. On Saturday, February 4 at
1:00pm you are invited to our second annual Youth
Music Festival, featuring ten youth choirs from various
ecumenical communities, as well as our own St. James
Cathedral Youth Music Program. In addition to choral
music, there will be a duet sung by two stars of the
future, and a performance by a young organist. The
annual “Outstanding Young Artist Award” will also be
presented. All are welcome!</p>
<p><b>CONFIRMATION CLASSES FOR ADULTS AND HIGH
SCHOOL STUDENTS</b> 16 years and older begin
Thursday, February 16, 6:30-8:30 pm in Cathedral
Place Room 411. Full sacramental initiation (Baptism,
Confirmation, and Eucharist) is important for all
practicing Catholics, and is particularly important for
those who are considering getting married.

<p><b>CELEBRATING CATHOLIC SCHOOLS – RAINBOW
SCHOOLS COALITION</b>. On the weekend of February 4-5
we will celebrate Catholic School education, and in a
particular way the Cathedral children who attend one of
the five Rainbow Schools. Our parish is a contributing
member of the Rainbow Schools Program whereby
children from our parish can attend at “parishioner”
tuition rates. Approximately 60 cathedral children are
enrolled in one of these terrific schools. On February 5
representatives of St. Edward, St. George, St. Paul, St.
Joseph and St. Therese Catholics Schools will be
available following the 10:00am and Noon Masses
during hospitality. Children are encouraged to come to
Mass in their uniforms. In addition, our parish has
established the Cathedral Scholarship Fund to assist
families in meeting the financial obligation involved in
sending their elementary school aged children to any
one of the Rainbow Schools. <i>Information</i>,

age of 10. But many years later he wrote to his
parents, “Ever since I left home, towards the age
of ten, I have read many books and learned many

what I learned from you remains the
most precious and important, and it
