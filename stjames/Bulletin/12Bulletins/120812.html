	<p dir="ltr"><b>HELP FEED THE HUNGRY</b>. Several times every month,
teams of St. James parishioners cook and serve dinner
for 150-170 homeless people at the Operation Nightwatch Center near Seattle University. We urgently
need a volunteer to prepare dinner once a month—on
either the 1st or the 3rd Tuesday from 5:00 to 8:30 pm.
During October, one of our longtime cooks will be on
vacation, so we will be in special need of assistance.
Please consider joining this deeply rewarding ministry.

<p><b>GROUP SUPPORT AND EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR
THOSE LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS</b>. The Mental
Health Ministry presents NAMI’s Peer to Peer
Education Course (National Alliance on Mental
Illness). The NAMI Peer-to-Peer education course is a
10-week, experiential education course on the topic of
recovery for any person with serious mental illness who
is interested in establishing and maintaining wellness.
The course uses a combination of lecture, interactive
exercises and structured group processes. Courses are
taught by teams of three trained peer-teachers, who are
living in recovery. Participants must have a diagnosis of
mental illness, and stable for the last 6 months; they
should also be comfortable sharing and hearing
sensitive and emotional issues in a group setting. The
10-week program begins Thursday August 30, 3:30-5:30pm in the Gallagher Center. There are 6 spaces to
fill and there will be a total of about 16 “Peers.” You
must register by August 15 to attend. <i>Information, or to
register</i>,&nbsp;

<p><b>THE ST. VINCENT DE PAUL CONFERENCES OF ST.
JAMES</b> thank Cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During July we made 61 home
visits to our low income neighbors. Your contributions
allowed us to help 48 individuals and families pay their
rent and stay safely in their homes. In addition, we
prevented 8 utility shut-offs, provided food for 29
families, beds and furniture for 18 households, clothes
for 6 people, baby items for one family, and
transportation assistance for 6 individuals. Our priority
is preventing homelessness. This makes your
contributions go a long way. Helping our neighbors pay
their rent is far cheaper than picking up the pieces after
they lose their homes. Members of the St. Vincent de
Paul Society follow Jesus through service to those in
need. Bearing witness to Christ’s compassionate and
liberating love, we show our commitment through
person-to-person contact, making our home visits in
pairs. Please consider joining our ministry to the poor
among us. <i>Information</i>, Rob Millar 206-954-8902 and
Tammy Bendix 206-595-9158.</p>
<p><b>SUMMER FILM FESTIVAL</b>. Join us on Tuesday, August
21 for our 3rd Summer Film Festival offerings. We are
delighted to offer a fun and uplifting musical film,
<i>Joyful Noise</i>, starring Queen Latifah and Dolly
Parton. Let’s see what happens when two strongminded
women are forced to cooperate when budget
cuts threaten to shut down a small-town choir. The film
will be shown in Cathedral Place, 2nd floor at 7:00pm.
Popcorn and lemonade will be provided and you are
welcome to bring your favorite movie treats.
