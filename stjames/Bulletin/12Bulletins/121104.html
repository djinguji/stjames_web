<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Of all our wonderful staff members here at St. James, the one who has served
here the longest is Marianne Coté. Marianne was hired in January, 1979, as the cook
for some half dozen priests who lived in the Cathedral rectory, and a wonderful job
she did, not only as cook but as trusted confidant to a house full of priests. She was
serving in that capacity when I arrived here in 1988. A couple of years later, when
there were only two priests still living in the rectory, it was no longer realistic to have
a full-time cook and that’s when, to my way of thinking, Marianne discovered her
true calling! After a little friendly persuasion on my part (and a lot of hesitation on
hers!), she agreed to take responsibility for our children’s faith formation program.</p>
<p>The rest is history, as the saying goes. And what a great history it is! When
Marianne took over, we had no more than a large handful of kids involved in
Sunday school. Thanks to her untiring efforts and her marvelous ability to reach out
to children and their families, the program began to grow by leaps and bounds.
Then, after the Cathedral renovation was completed in 1994 and the parish began to
attract families from all over the region, Marianne more than had her hands full. But
she carried on wonderfully – recruiting more and more volunteer catechists and
attracting more and more families. But she did more than grow the numbers: she
gave the program a heart and a soul. She endeared herself to a whole generation of
kids and their families with her warm-hearted, no-nonsense, tell-it-like-it-is
approach. More importantly, she helped to inspire in them a deep love for the Lord
as well as a genuine love for the poor and the needy. In a word, she made the
Catholic faith come alive for them.</p>
<p>Now, after nearly 34 years, Marianne has decided it’s time to retire. Well, not
completely. Happily, she intends to continue to involve herself in the children’s faith
formation program as a volunteer, and for that we can all be grateful.</p>
<p>If you know Marianne, you know she is not one for public recognition. In
fact, it’s the last thing she wants. Nonetheless, we are not going to let this moment
pass without taking time to thank her for her incredible gift of service to this
community over these many years. Please join our children’s faith formation families
at a special reception for Marianne after the noon Mass today. She may not love all
the acclaim and applause, but I know she’ll love seeing you!</p>
<p>Marianne, in the name of this parish community that you have served so long,
so faithfully, so lovingly, and so effectively, a huge THANK YOU and an assurance
of prayers now and in the days to come.</p>

the extra mile for our dinner guests at the Cathedral

to have a special celebration not only for Easter, but
also a barbeque meal in honor of the warm summer
days; and last week, as though the first two meals were
not enough, we had a special harvest fare including
fresh pumpkin pie with whipped cream. Thank you,
