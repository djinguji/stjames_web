<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

<p><b>ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND/OR BECOMING
CATHOLIC?</b> You are invited to participate in the RCIA, a process of 
initiation into the Catholic community of faith. It is a process which 
encompasses the study of Scripture, Catholic teaching, and Christian values—the 
development and deepening of a life of prayer and action—all with the support 
and involvement of the parish community. You can learn more by going to the <a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/RCIA">RCIA website</a>. 
A new inquiry session will begin Wednesday, April 25 at 7:00 pm in Cathedral 
Place, second floor. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ARE YOU A CATHOLIC WHO HAS BEEN AWAY FROM
THE CHURCH?</b> Our Welcome Back program provides
a safe place, in the company of others who are also
examining their faith, to ask questions about returning
to regular church attendance, returning to the
sacraments, and to learn about changes in the church.
The sessions are offered on Mondays, April 23 through
July 16, 7:00-9:00pm on 2nd floor Cathedral
Place. Classes are offered without any obligation.

	<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During March we made a total of
58 home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions allowed us to keep 51 individuals and
families from being evicted from their homes, and to
prevent utility shut-offs for 7 households. We provided
food for 6 families, furniture to 10 households, and
clothes for 5 people. We were also able to help 5
people with transportation costs. Our priority is
preventing homelessness; this makes your contributions
go a long way. Helping our neighbors to pay their rent
costs us an average of $6 per bed night. This is far
cheaper than picking up the pieces after people lose
their housing. Shelters cost $15-20 per bed night, and
motels cost $50 or more per night. Members of the St.
Vincent de Paul Society follow Jesus through service to
those in need. Bearing witness to Christ’s
compassionate and liberating love, we show our
commitment through person-to-person contact, making
our home visits in pairs. Please consider joining our
ministry to the poor among us. <i>Information</i>, Rob Millar

Vatican Council, will be established in the north aisle of the
Cathedral. Throughout the year, keep an eye on this box in the

elected Pope? Much emotion, to be sure, and a
host of anxieties. But also the same sensation as
a baby in swaddling clothes,

had slipped over me was very tight

wrapped up like a mummy.”</p>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Mark in
Shoreline and Our Lady of Good Counsel Mission in
Eatonville.</p>
