<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral, we
want you to know how welcome you are – whether
you have come from another part of the country,
from across the world, or simply from another parish here in
the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of visitors
like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s liturgy here
in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also able to offer a
wide range of services to needy people living in the central
district of our city.</i> </p>

the main meal, sandwich meats, sliced cheese, and
condiment packets. Protein is in high demand and short
supply. Please leave your donations marked Operation

on Sunday, or deliver them to the Parish Office before
4:00 pm on the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays of the month.

<p><b>THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b> conferences of St. James
thank cathedral parishioners for their generous
donations last month. During January, we made a total
of 55 home visits to our low income neighbors. Your
contributions allowed us to keep 38 individuals and
families from being evicted from their homes. We
helped one family avoid the shut-off of their utilities.
We also provided food for 37 households, and gave out
16 vouchers to the St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Store for
clothes, household items, beds and other furniture.
Members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society follow
Jesus through service to those in need. Bearing witness
to Christ’s compassionate and liberating love, we show
our commitment through person-to-person contact,
making our home visits in pairs. We are actively
seeking new members to join our ministry.
<i>Information</i>, Rob Millar 206-954-8902 and Tammy Bendix 206-595-9158.</p>
<p><b>WINTER SHELTER DONATIONS</b>. Our shelter guests need
disposable razors, lip balm, and cough drops. Please
bring your donations to Cathedral Hall during coffee
hour after Sunday Mass or drop them off at the parish
office Monday to Friday, 9am-5pm.</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES IS A PLACE FOR CHILDREN</b>. We encourage
all of our parishioners who attend Mass with young
children, and we welcome them into our midst. Many
families find that sitting in the front rows, where the
view is unobstructed, allows children to participate
more fully. Others are more comfortable sitting at the
ends of the aisles, so that they can easily step into the
west vestibule or the Cathedral Chapel, if their child
needs a quiet place away from the assembly. We have
provided a sound system in these areas so you can
continue to participate in Mass. We appreciate your
effort to be with us and to include your child in our
worship. For those who wish, babysitting is available in
the Mother Cabrini Room at the Pastoral Outreach
Center during the 10:00 am and 12 Noon Masses.</p>

talk on the Immaculate Conception in a Roman
parish shortly after his ordination—“was a
disaster. I mixed up quotations from the Old and
the New Testaments. I confused
St. Alphonsus with St. Bernard.
I mistook writings of the Fathers
for writings of the prophets. A
fiasco. I was so ashamed.”</p>

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Peter in
Seattle and the mission churches of St. Peter in Deming,
Suquamish, and Tenino.</p>
