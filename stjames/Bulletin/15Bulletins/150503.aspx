<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><b>COVER ART</b>. The face of Our Lady of Guadalupe is
featured on the cover of today’s bulletin as we celebrate
Mary in a special way during the month of May. A copy
of the miraculous image of Our Lady of Guadalupe will
hang in the south aisle of the West Nave throughout the
month.</p>
<p><b>FLORAL DONATIONS</b>. Floral donations are a wonderful
way to remember a deceased loved one or
commemorate an important anniversary, and at the same
time enrich the whole parish community! Right now, we
have an opening the weekend of May 9-10, Mother’s
Day Weekend. If you would like to offer flowers,
contact <a href="mailto:jmueller@stjames-cathedral.org?subject=Floral Donations">

<p><b>I SAW ETERNITY THE OTHER NIGHT</b>. Our series on the
metaphysical poets continues with poems by Henry
Vaughan (1621-1695) and Thomas Traherne (1636-1674) Vaughan’s work anticipates Wordsworth in its
celebration of the innocence of childhood. Traherne’s
extraordinary imagination, anticipating William Blake,
was largely unknown until the rediscovery of his work
in the early 20th century. Tuesday, May 5, 7:00pm in
Room 1EW, Cathedral Place. <i>Information</i>,
