<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. <b>Newcomers and visitors are invited to stop by the
welcome table at Coffee Hours to find out more about St.
James Cathedral and ask questions of a staff member</b>.</i> </p>

<p><b>CAMINO SEATTLE WALK TODAY</b>. Camino Seattle began
last Sunday! You can collect your stamps for the week at
the Welcome Table at Coffee Hour, or at the Cathedral
Bookstore after all Masses. All are welcome to join a 3-mile walk after the 10:00am Mass. Starting from the
Cathedral's front steps, our walk will take us past some
of the Catholic institutions that have made their mark on
our city, including schools, parishes, hospitals, the
Archbishop's residence, and one important parish that's
not there anymore. We will take a few very short breaks
for history tidbits along the way. Gather on the west
steps (in front of the bronze doors) at 11:15am.</p>
<p><b>ANNUAL CATHOLIC APPEAL</b>. A huge thank you to the
845 Cathedral households have donated an extraordinary
$512,888 to the Annual Catholic Appeal. <b><i>We are now
just $43,770 short of our combined parish and
Archdiocesan goal of $556,658</i></b>. If you have not yet

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. During a home
visit, we presented a disabled woman with a grocery
store gift card. Her face beamed with joy when we said
she could buy not only food but also soap and toilet
paper. She then spoke eloquently about the importance
of “human dignity, even in poverty” and the “shame”
she experienced when slipping into a local coffeehouse
to take paper napkins because she could not afford toilet
paper. Every dollar you give to SVdP makes a
difference in someone’s life – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>PROCLAIMING THE WORD</b>. Serving as a reader at

Scriptures and the liturgy. We are currently in need of
more experienced readers at all Masses. All training is
provided. <i>Information</i>,
