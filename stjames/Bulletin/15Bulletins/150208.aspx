<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in loving
memory of Bruce Campbell, from his family.</p>
<p><b>MASS IN THE YEAR OF CONSECRATED LIFE</b>. Today,
Sunday, February 8, women and men religious from
across the Archdiocese of Seattle join us at the 12 Noon
Mass for a celebration of the gift of consecrated life in
the Church. This is a special opportunity to give thanks
to God for the religious who have made a difference in
our lives and our faith. There will also be an
opportunity to explore a vocation to one of the many
different religious communities in the Archdiocese.</p>
<p><b>SEEKING A CHEF</b>. We are seeking a chef who could
help coordinate and prepare our St. Patrick’s Day
Pancake Breakfast, which benefits the Solanus Casey

our volunteers. Can you help? <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>THE ESPRESSO MINISTRY</b> is up and running after the
10:00am Mass. This month, all espresso sales benefit
the Youth Music Program.</p>

<p><b>CELEBRATION OF THE SANTO NIÑO</b>. The Friends of
Santo Niño would like to thank the many parishioners
who helped make this year’s Santo Niño fiesta another
memorable event. Special thanks to the Fil-Am Choir,
to the volunteers who helped serve the food and stayed
to clean up, and to those who donated cash and desserts
and all who supported our raffle. Your patronage makes
it possible for us to continue this annual tradition.
<i>Maraming salamat po</i>!</p>
<p><b>PRAYERS TO OUR LADY OF LOURDES</b>. The men and
women of the Order of Malta will be going on
pilgrimage to the healing shrine of Lourdes in southern
France later this year. They will take with them
intentions from local parishes, which will be
remembered in prayer at the Grotto of Our Lady of
Lourdes. Stop by the Shrine of the Blessed Virgin Mary
today or any time during the next week, write your
petition on the form provided, and drop it in the box of
intentions.</p>
<p><b>SOCIETY OF ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b>. Did you know that
February 7 is the Feast of Blessed Rosalie Rendu (1786-1856)? Living in a time of revolution, cholera and
widespread poverty, this Daughter of Charity of St
Vincent de Paul cared for the sick, the elderly, the poor
and orphans (at times risking her own life) for over 50
years in the poorest district of Paris. In the 1830s, when
Frederic Ozanam and his student companions at the
Sorbonne wanted to learn how to help the poor, Sister
Rosalie became their mentor. She taught them how to
do home visits and to always treat everyone with
dignity and love – lessons those young men followed in
establishing the Society of St Vincent de Paul and that
are still followed today by 800,000 Vincentians
volunteering in 140 countries worldwide, including here
in the parish of St James Cathedral. Won’t you join us
in this important work? <i>Information</i>,
