<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><b>COVER ART</b>. <i>Tree of Life</i>. Detail of the Tympanum of
the Ceremonial Bronze Doors, Ulrich Henn, artist,

<p><b>ANNUAL CATHOLIC APPEAL</b>. Just a reminder, if you
haven’t yet made a gift to the Appeal, please do so
today! We are almost there, but we are still $72,000
short of meeting our rebate goal. This year’s rebate will
help support our renowned Cathedral music programs.
Use the envelopes in the pews in front of you or visit

mentors. Do you have a heart for children with
special needs? Can you make a weekly
commitment? Please contact Joe to learn more.</p>

<p><b>CARE FOR CREATION</b>. During the coming week, Pope
Francis’ long-awaited second encyclical will be
released. The new encyclical focuses on our Christian
call to care for the environment and to preserve God’s
creation. It is entitled “Laudato Sii,” from the first
words of St. Francis’ “Canticle of Brother Sun.” We
will mark this important moment with a special prayer
on Friday, June 19 at 6:30pm in the Cathedral. Through
prayer, silence, and song, we will reflect on our own
call to be good stewards of the earth.</p>
<p><b>GARDEN BLESSING NEXT SUNDAY</b>. Next Sunday, June
21, following the 10:00am Mass, Father Ryan will bless
the Cathedral Kitchen Garden at Cherry Street and
Terry Avenue. Please come and join in a brief prayer,
followed by a chance to learn more about the garden
and sample its produce, which helps provide meals at
the Cathedral Kitchen. What better way to mark the first
official day of summer?</p>
