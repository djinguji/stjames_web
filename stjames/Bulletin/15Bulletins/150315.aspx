<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><strong>CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</strong>. Stop by the Cathedral
Bookstore for a wide selection of great spiritual reading
for Lent. We also have Cathedral souvenirs, rosaries,
and religious medals in stock.</p>
<p><strong>ST. PATRICK’S DAY PANCAKE BREAKFAST</strong>. Our annual
pancake extravaganza benefiting our own Solanus Casey
Center will be held TODAY, Sunday, March 15 after the
10am and Noon Masses. Delicious pancakes, sausages,
and potatoes thanks to our volunteer chef Brendan
O’Farrell and his team of volunteers, a fun raffle, and
Irish dancers following the Noon Mass. Please join us
for this fun event for a good cause!</p>
<p><strong>LENTEN HOLY HOUR</strong>. Because of a funeral Mass, we will
not be able to have Holy Hour on Friday, March 20. Our
Lenten Holy Hours will resume on Friday, March 27.
Thank you for your understanding!</p>
<p><strong>OPERATION RICE BOWL</strong>. This week, we journey with CRS Rice 
Bowl to Lebanon to be present to a people who themselves are on a journey. Here 
we meet a family of Syrian refugees, a family perhaps not so unlike our own. We 
are challenged through our almsgiving this week to reach out to those who are 
forced to flee their homes, who are seeking shelter in a land of peace.

<a href="http://www.crsricebowl.org" target="_bulletin">www.crsricebowl.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>PLACE OF LIGHT, PLACE OF WELCOME</strong>. Thanks so
much to all who have contributed to our new Capital
Campaign to relight the Cathedral and provide greatly

$20,000 challenge grant and even surpassed it! If you
