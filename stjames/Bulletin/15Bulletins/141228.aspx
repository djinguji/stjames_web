<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>As we prepare for a New Year, we naturally look to the future, but
who of us ends a year without looking to the past, as well? It’s the
combination of both - reflection and resolution - that makes the marking of a
New Year so very important.</p>
<p>This year, I invite you to reflect with me, not just on the past year but
on the past three decades and more here at St. James Cathedral. It was that
long ago (1981, to be exact) that Dr. James Savage took in hand the reins (and
tattered reins they were!) of the Cathedral’s director of music. In the
intervening years he has created a music program that is the envy of
cathedrals across this country and beyond. From the one rather shaky, if
spirited, choir that Jim inherited in 1981, the Cathedral now has five adult
choirs and four youth choirs. And this does not count the Cathedral’s four
highly respected “resident ensembles” (Jim’s brainchild), or the wonderful
Cathedral Orchestra and Cathedral Brass.</p>
<p>In addition, there has been, over many years, the highly popular and
incredibly imaginative <i>Great Music for Great Cathedrals</i>, not to mention a
yearly offering of concerts that have attracted the attention of the community
at large as well as the acclaim of the professional critics. Beyond those, has
been the highly important role as aesthetic advisor that Jim played in the
major renovation and restoration of the Cathedral (1991-1994) and in every
major building project since then (including the bronze doors, the east apse
organ, the tabernacle, the courtyard, the Pastoral Outreach Center, the shrine
of St. John XXIII).</p>
<p>But, speaking for myself, all these accomplishments pale next to the
role Jim has played in making the worshipping community of St. James a
community that loves to sing and sings incredibly well. Any pastor would
think he had won the lottery if he inherited a congregation that makes such
beautiful music together week after week!</p>
<p>So, you see why it’s important for us to look back some distance this
New Year’s Eve. And to that I would add that it is also important that we
look back with deep gratitude for Jim’s incalculable contribution toward
making St. James Cathedral the “Great Cathedral” it is. In expressing my
own deep gratitude to him, I invite you to do the same and I know you will
take time to pray for him as he begins a new chapter in his life.</p>
<p>And now, a little look to the future. Joseph Adam, who has served as
Cathedral organist for over 20 years, has agreed to serve as interim director
of music until a national search is able to identify a permanent director. I am
extremely grateful to Joseph for taking this on and have every confidence
that his superior musical skills as well as his long and deep commitment to
the Cathedral – its life and its music – will serve us well in the days and
months ahead. Joseph has always been a wonderful team-player and has
earned the respect, not only of the Cathedral’s musicians, volunteers and
professionals, but also of our pastoral staff and parishioners. His list of
accomplishments in the world of music are impressive, to say the least, and I
have every reason to believe that he will add significantly to that list while he
directs the Cathedral’s music program.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, New Year’s Eve, Jim will conduct his last concert
in the Cathedral. I encourage you to be a part of it, if you are able, in order to
celebrate this milestone moment and bid Jim a fond farewell. Above all,
grateful for the past and hopeful for the future, I pray that the year ahead
will be full of good things and blessings without number for both Jim and
Joseph, and for St. James Cathedral!</p>
