<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><strong>NEW ON THE CATHEDRAL WEBSITE</strong>. Visit the web site to relive the liturgies of Holy Week: view
photo albums of Palm Sunday, the Triduum, and Easter
Sunday, read Father Ryan’s homilies, and more! Also:
the Cathedral is on social media! Join the 3,940 people
who follow St. James on Facebook (stjamesseattle) and
Instagram (stjamescathedral).</p>
<p><strong>ECUMENICAL ICON OF THE RESURRECTION</strong>. This
weekend, St. James Cathedral is privileged once again to
host a beautiful icon of Christ’s Resurrection. The icon,
written by Yakov Prokofiev of St. Petersburg, was
commissioned by the St. Petersburg Seattle Sister
Churches Board to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their
program, which encourages friendly relations between
churches in Seattle and St. Petersburg. The icon was
blessed by Metropolitan Vladimir and brought to Seattle
in the summer of 2011. During this Easter Season, it is
traveling around the Pacific Northwest to churches of
many Christian denominations.</p>
	<p><strong>IT’S NOT TOO LATE TO JOIN OUR WELCOME BACK</strong> for Returning 
	Catholics sessions, now in progress. This is a parish program designed to 
	update you on the Catholic Church, and to learn more about your faith. It’s 
	a warm, welcoming place where you can bring questions about faith and

	continue each Monday evening into June. Location is Cathedral Place, 803 
	Terry Ave. <em>Information</em>,

<p><strong>BREATHING THE WATER</strong>. On Monday, April 27, at
7:00pm, Pastoral Outreach Center, you are invited to
learn more about the life and work of Denise Levertov.
Levertov was a great 20th-century American poet who
lived in Seattle from 1989 until the time of her death in
1997. A convert to Catholicism, she wrote about faith,
nature, the environment, politics, and social justice. Our
speakers will be Seattle writer and teacher Rebecca
Brown and Patty Bowman, Director of Outreach at St.
James Cathedral. The event kicks off a city-wide series of
events celebrating Levertov. <em>Information</em>,
