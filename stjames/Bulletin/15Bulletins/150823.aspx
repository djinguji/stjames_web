<p><b>WELCOME SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James
Cathedral is proud to welcome visitors from
near and far throughout the summer
months. Each week a drawing for a Cathedral gift will
be made from among all the visitor envelopes used.
Please write your address on the visitor envelope
provided in the pew and drop it with your offering into
the collection basket. Thank you for adding to the
power of our prayer by your presence in our midst
today. <b>Last
Sunday, we had visitors from Henderson, NV; Port
Sanilac, MI; Glendale Heights, IL, and many other places.
The winner of our drawing was from Fontana, CA.</b></i> </p>
<p><b>COVER ART</b> <i>The Holy Name of God</i>. Stained-glass
roundel, West Nave Clerestory. Charles Connick, artist,
1917-1919.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are from the Saturday
wedding of Kristen O’Neill and Wes Phillips. Flowers
are also from Reza and Ryan Cueto in celebration of
their son Ryley’s first birthday.</p>
<p><b>WHAT SUSTAINS US?</b> Come by the Cathedral Chapel
this month to view a traveling art exhibit from the
Grunewald Guild, as artists explore the theme of
sustenance. Where do we find nourishment for our
bodies, our spirits, our communities, and our land? The
show will hang in the chapel August 1-28.</p>
<p><b>HUNTHAUSEN AUCTION SEPTEMBER 14</b>. We are looking
for items for our “Movie Night” basket. New DVD’s,
pizza gift cards, Netflix gift cards, popcorn and movie
night snacks, sodas and drinks. Consider donating them

<p><b>IS YOUR MARRIAGE ALL IT WAS MEANT TO BE?</b> Are you
struggling in your marriage? Do you feel a sense of
disillusionment or sadness? Do you wish you could
rekindle the spark you once had, but just don’t know how?
You are not alone. Retrouvaille (pronounced retro-v&#299;) can
help. <i>Confidential information or registration</i> for our
upcoming program beginning September 18-20, 2015:

<p><b>ST. THERESE ALUMNI REUNION</b>. Summer Block Party
2015 "Honoring our past, Embracing our present,
Celebrating our future." Please join us as we gather
together six decades (1960-2015) of St. Therese Alumni
for an afternoon of fun, food and nostalgia. St. Therese
Catholic Academy, Saturday, September 12, 12-5pm.
<i>Information</i>, visit

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
woman living in a building known for its bed bugs.
When the bugs infested her room, the landlord threw
out her bed and many personal belongings. Even worse,
the woman told us that her adult children had stopped
visiting and refused to let her into their homes to see her
beloved grandchildren–they feared she would bring bed
bugs. The good news is her room is now “bed bug free,”
so we promised a new bed and, at her request, joined
hands and prayed that her broken family can now be
healed. Your support made this possible–thank you!
