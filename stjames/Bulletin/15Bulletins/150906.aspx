<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL SOCIETY CELEBRATES</b> the
September 9 Feast Day of Blessed Frederic Ozanam
(1813-53). Frederic was a university student in 1830s
Paris when he and a few friends started what became
the Society of St Vincent de Paul in response to a
challenge to “do” something about poverty, rather than
merely talking about it. Like Vincentians today, they
went in pairs to visit the poor in their homes, offering
material aid and spiritual comfort. Although Frederic
became a lawyer, he devoted his brief life to helping
others, teaching us that the poor are “the sacred images
of that God who we do not see.” That concept still
resonates with SVdP members, who seek spiritual
growth through service to our neighbors in need.
