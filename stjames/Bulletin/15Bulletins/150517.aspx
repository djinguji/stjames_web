<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><b>COVER ART</b>. The Fifteenth Station of the Cross shows the
Resurrection of the Lord. This work, by Joan Brand-Landkamer, Cathedral iconographer, was inspired by the
work of Georges Rouault and created from driftwood
pieces the artist collected on the beach in Ocean Shores.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are given in honor of Father
David Brant on the 50th anniversary of his ordination to
the priesthood from Jason, Bethie, Charlotte, and Peter
Hungerford. <i>Ad multos annos</i>!</p>
<p><b>CELEBRATING WITH FATHER DAVID BRANT</b>. This
Sunday, we will recognize Father David Brant in a
special way at the Noon Mass as he marks the 50th
anniversary of his ordination to the priesthood. A
reception will follow in Cathedral Hall.</p>
<p><b>RCIA REUNION</b>. Calling all former RCIA participants!
Are you someone who has come through the RCIA
process at St. James? Please join us for a social time to
check in and catch up. We will gather on Tuesday
evening, May 19, 7:00pm. If you can attend, RSVP to

McCabe</a>, 206-382-2018.</p>
<p><b>TUESDAY EVENING NIGHTWATCH VOLUNTEER</b>. St.
James Cathedral has a long history of sending volunteers
to Operation Nightwatch (14th Ave &amp; Main St) to help feed people experiencing 
homelessness. There is currently a volunteer needed on the first Tuesday of the 
month, 8:30pm-10:30pm, to serve a meal to 100+ guests. If you are interested, 
please contact

<p><b>THANK YOU FROM THE ST VINCENT DE PAUL SOCIETY</b>.
We visited an elderly woman who was homeless until
recently. Since getting a small apartment, she has been
careful to pay her rent on time as keeping her home is
the most important thing to her. Fighting back tears, she
told us she paid all her bills in cash, which she kept in
her purse–which she left on the bus one day, a purse that
never made it to Metro’s “lost & found.” Without that
cash, she could not pay rent and got an eviction notice.
With money you donated to SVdP at the Cathedral, we
helped pay her rent and keep a roof over her head–thank
you! <i>Information</i>, Barb Schmidt, 206-938-8696.</p>
