<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>You will notice this weekend that both the outer and inner doors at the Terry
and Marion and the Archbishop Murphy Courtyard entrances to the Cathedral have
now been fitted with electrified door openers for the benefit of the physically
challenged. This happy and long-awaited improvement is only the first of several
phases of our <b>Place of Light, Place of Welcome</b> project to which many of you have
made generous contributions during the past year.</p>
<p>You probably remember from an article in <i>In Your Midst</i>, that the major focus of
the <b>Place of Light, Place of Welcome</b> project will be the dramatic lighting of the
exterior of the Cathedral which will allow the Cathedral to reclaim its prominence and
beauty on the city skyline and also make the Cathedral grounds much safer at night.
Other aspects of the project involve the retrofitting of many of the electrical fixtures
inside the Cathedral, allowing the use of LED bulbs that, over time, will be both
energy efficient and much more cost effective than the present ones. Lastly, new
signage, more friendly for both parishioners and visitors alike, will soon be installed
around the campus.</p>
<p>The actual construction involved with the exterior lighting of the Cathedral
will, as you might expect, be quite extensive and time-consuming. The height of the
towers alone would make it so, but when you add to that the mysteries of a building
that is nearly 110 years old now, you can begin to see the ramifications--and
unexpected surprises—of a major project of this sort.</p>
<p>When we launched the fundraising for the project this time last year, we did
our best, with the help of the best experts available, to estimate the costs involved
which seemed quite manageable ($1 million). For that reason we took a very low-key
approach to the fundraising. Now it is clear that our estimate of $1 million was quite
conservative, to say the least. And so, in light of considerable cost-overruns, we are
now seeking to raise an additional $175,000. If you would like to make a contribution
to <b>Place of Light, Place of Welcome</b>, it will be most welcome. A one-time gift would
be appreciated or, if you prefer, the gift can be made over a three-year period. You’ll
find more information in today’s bulletin.</p>
<p>The good news about all this is that the newly-lit Cathedral will glow in a way
that it never has. And I like the thought that as we, in communion with Pope Francis
and the Church throughout the world, launch the Holy Year of Mercy on this coming
December 8, St. James Cathedral will shine out as a beacon not only of light but of
mercy for our city and our region!</p>
