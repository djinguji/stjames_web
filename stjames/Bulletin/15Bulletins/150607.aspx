<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>

Apse stained-glass window by Hans Gottfried von

Mass. Visitors and regulars alike are invited to stop in
to browse a wide selection of reading material for both
children and adults, as well as Cathedral music CDs,
Cathedral postcards and souvenirs, medals and crosses,
and much more.</p>
<p><b>ON THE NEXT SENIOR TRIP</b> Wednesday, June 10, you
might be peering out of the tram at bellowing bison less
than 10 feet away or standing nose-to-nose with an
otter: both common wildlife encounters at Northwest
Trek. Space is limited and priority will be given to
registered parishioners over the age of 65. <i>Information,
or to reserve your place</i>,

launched a faith mentor program for children with
special needs. Teens worked one-on-one with
children in the development of their faith, allowing
for full inclusion. We plan to offer this program
again in the fall, but are in need of new faith
mentors. Do you have a heart for children with
special needs? Can you make a weekly
commitment? Please contact Joe to learn more.</p>
