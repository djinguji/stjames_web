<p><b>SOCIETY OF ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b>. Young adults
started SVdP because they wanted to go to the poor in
their humble homes, listening to their needs. SVdP at St
James Cathedral needs adult volunteers of all ages, but
we especially need more young adults to join our
ministry to the poor. Most volunteers attend two
Tuesday evening Vincentian gatherings (90 minutes
each) per month and make home visits to our neighbors
in need 2-3 times per month (afternoons or evenings,
about 2-3 hours each time). Please consider this
wonderful opportunity to make a real difference in the
lives of people who are calling out for our help.
