<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><b>COVER ART</b>. <i>Noah in the ark</i>. Detail of the central East
Apse stained-glass window by Hans Gottfried von
Stockhausen, 1994.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are in honor of Irene Telmo on her 95th birthday, 
from her family. <i>If you
would like to donate flowers this summer, contact

Jane Mueller</a>, 206-654-4650</i>.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL KITCHEN GARDEN BLESSING</b>. Today,
following the 10:00am Mass, Father Ryan will bless
the Cathedral Kitchen Garden at Cherry Street and
Terry Avenue. Please follow the procession and join in
a brief prayer, followed by a chance to learn more
about the garden and sample its produce, which helps
provide meals at the Cathedral Kitchen. What better
way to mark the first official day of summer?</p>
<p><b>ANNUAL CATHOLIC APPEAL</b>. We have some good
news and some not-so-good news. The good news is
that 798 Cathedral households have donated an
extraordinary $490,358 to the Annual Catholic Appeal.
Now for the bad news: gratifying as this response is,
we are still $62,150 short of our combined parish and
Archdiocesan goal of $556,658. The need is urgent: if
we do not meet our rebate goal, we will have no choice
but to make cuts to our budget. If you have not yet
made your donation, please consider doing so this week
at <a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.seattlearchdiocese.org/aca">www.seattlearchdiocese.org/aca</a>. If you have
already made your donation, please consider having it
matched by your employer! Many companies match
ACA gifts, including Boeing, Costco, Microsoft,
Starbucks, and many more. <i>Information</i>,

children in the development of their faith, allowing
for full inclusion. We plan to offer this program
again in the fall, but are in need of new faith
mentors. Do you have a heart for children with
special needs? Can you make a weekly
commitment? Please contact Joe to learn more.</p>
<p><b>NICARAGUA DONATIONS</b>. The NPH orphanage is in
need of the following items: ESL beginner level
workbooks, 5th/6th grade level reading books in
Spanish, board games (e.g. UNO, Connect Four,
Trouble, Sorry, etc.), art supplies (e.g. markers,
colored pencils, paint brushes, pastels, and colored
paper), sports equipment (e.g. jump ropes, soccer
balls, etc.) and cookie cutters. Donations can be
dropped off at the parish center. All items will be
delivered during the youth mission trip.</p>

Masses. To prepare for this most important sacrament,
parents and godparents participate in a series of classes

their responsibility to guide their children in the practice
of the faith, and to learn about the many ways our parish
supports families. Please allow at least two months for
preparation. <i>Information</i>,
