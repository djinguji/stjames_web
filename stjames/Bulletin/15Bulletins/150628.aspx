<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>

a short walk (1.5 mi) after the 10:00am Mass. We’ll take
in the highlights of one of Seattle’s oldest
neighborhoods: First Hill! We will start from our
beloved Cathedral and walk the tree-lined streets as we
highlight some historic buildings and glimpse the glory
days of this neighborhood. We will take a few short
breaks for a little bit of First Hill history along the way.

10 o’clock Mass today. Passports are available in the
Cathedral Bookstore and in Cathedral Hall at coffee
hours.</p>

Mass. Visitors and regulars alike are invited to stop in to

our combined parish and Archdiocesan goal of $556,658</i>. If you have not yet
made your donation, please consider doing so this week
at <a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.seattlearchdiocese.org/aca">www.seattlearchdiocese.org/aca</a>. If you have
