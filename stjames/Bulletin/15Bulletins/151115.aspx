<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our <b>Sunday Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered by Shirley
Wright and Louise Douglas in loving memory of their
husbands, David Wright and Don Douglas.</p>
<p><b>MASS OF THANKSGIVING DAY</b>. On Thursday, November
26 at 9:30am, we will have our annual Thanksgiving
Day Mass, during which all are invited to bring forward
non-perishable food items to be shared with the poor and
needy in our neighborhood. What better way to begin
our national feast of Thanksgiving than by celebrating
the Eucharist as a parish family?</p>
<p><b>MOTHER CABRINI CELEBRATION!</b> Cabrini Ministry

<p><b>COLLEGE STUDENT SUPPORT GROUP</b>. Did you know
that 40% of all college students do not seek support
when feeling overwhelmed or experiencing depression,
anxiety, eating disorders, addiction or thoughts of
suicide? Non-traditional students like veterans, parents,
immigrants, those living with a mental health condition
or other complex situations may have even greater
challenges. Join psychology doctoral candidate Andrea
Salazar for Pizza and Problem Solving on Sunday,
December 6, 3:00-4:30pm in the Fireside Room,
Pastoral Outreach Center. The group will gather
monthly. RSVP to

pairs of socks, and we surpassed our goal and collected
2,632 pairs! Let’s see if we can get 3,000 pairs this
year!</p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL SOCIETY THANKS YOU</b> for your
donations to the special collection taken for SVdP each
month. Without your support, we could not provide
material aid to the hundreds of residents of St James
parish who call SVdP for help each year. We know that,
for many of you, dropping a dollar bill or more in the
SVdP collection basket is a sacrifice you willingly make
because it is important to you to help your neighbors in
need. Please know that every dollar you give makes a
tangible difference in someone’s life – thank you!
