<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><strong>TODAY: VOLUNTEER CHORE SERVICES AT COFFEE
HOUR</strong>. Stop by the Volunteer Chore Services (VCS) table at Coffee Hour 
today! VCS is a program of Catholic Community Services, and it matches 
lowincome, elderly neighbors with volunteers who can help with chores around the 
house. This important ministry helps people live independently for as long as 
possible while forming a meaningful relationship. If you are unable to make it 
to Coffee Hour, contact 
<a href="mailto:katrinah@ccsww.org?subject=Assist an Elderly Adult in our Community">
Katrina Hale</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NEXT SUNDAY IS PALM SUNDAY</strong>. Next Sunday’s
10:00am Mass will begin with the blessing of palms in
O’Dea Gym, followed by a procession to the
Cathedral. Please gather in the O’Dea Gym when you
arrive; there will be no access to the Cathedral until
after the procession.</p>
<p><strong>ST. PATRICK’S DAY PANCAKE BREAKFAST</strong>. A huge
thank you to all who joined in the fun of last Sunday’s
pancake breakfast. Thanks to your generosity, we were
able to raise $3,519 for the Solanus Casey Center!
Special thanks also to chef Brendan O’Farrell and 60+
volunteers for making this possible. Our sincere
apologies to folks at the Noon Mass who didn’t get
pancakes!</p>
<p><strong>THE HEALTH AND HEALING MINISTRY</strong> thanks all those
who supported last Sunday's blood drive (in spite of
the challenging weather). Here is the report from the
Blood Center: we were able to register 31 donors and
three of them were first time donors. Of those, we were
able to collect 22 units of whole blood. This means
that 66 units off different blood products are now
available to help save the lives of local patients!</p>
<p><strong>OPERATION RICE BOWL</strong>. CRS Rice Bowl brings our
Lenten journey back to Africa this week, to the
Democratic Republic of Congo. We join our fasting in
solidarity with people who go hungry, and we
remember in prayer the importance of building a
community that is willing to support those most in
need. Learn more at
<a href="http://www.crsricebowl.org" target="_bulletin">www.crsricebowl.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>EXPLORING THE GOSPELS OF LENT</strong>. Our evenings of reflection on 
the Gospels of Lent conclude on Tuesday, March 24 at 7:00pm, in the Holy Names 
Room at Cathedral Outreach Center. In this series, we meditate on and learn 
about the Gospel reading for the coming Sunday. <em>Information</em>,

Masses. To prepare for this most important sacrament,

their responsibility to guide their children in the
practice of the faith, and to learn about the many ways
our parish supports families. Please allow at least two
months for preparation. <em>Information</em>,
