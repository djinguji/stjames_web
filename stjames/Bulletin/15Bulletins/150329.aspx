<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>

us to serve those we encounter in our daily lives? Learn more at

<p><strong>THE FIRST SENIOR TRIP OF THE SEASON</strong> will be
Wednesday April 15. We will explore the Pompeii
exhibit at the Pacific Science Center. Pompeii vanished
in AD 79 beneath thick layers of volcanic ash left by the
eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The exhibition tells the
tale of this city, hidden from view and forgotten for
centuries until its rediscovery over 250 years ago.
Please join us and experience daily life in this bustling
Roman city! Space is limited and priority will be given
to registered parishioners. <em>Information, or to reserve
your place</em>,

<p><strong>BAPTISM OF INFANTS &amp; YOUNG CHILDREN</strong> (under the
age of 7) is celebrated monthly at one of the weekend
Masses. To prepare for this most important sacrament,
parents and godparents participate in a series of classes
to update their understanding of baptism, to reflect on
their responsibility to guide their children in the
practice of the faith, and to learn about the many ways
our parish supports families. Please allow at least two
months for preparation. <em>Information</em>,
