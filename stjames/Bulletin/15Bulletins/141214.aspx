<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><b>TWENTY YEARS LATER</b>. This month marks twenty years
since the rededication of St. James Cathedral following
its restoration and renovation in 1994. In honor of this
special anniversary, look for five history panels near the
font, ambo, cathedra, presider chair, and Blessed
Sacrament Chapel which include architect’s drawings
and photos of the construction process which brought
new life to our historic Cathedral.</p>
<p><b>NEW IN THE BOOKSTORE</b>. Pray your way through
Advent with reflections from G. K. Chesterton, St.
Francis, Henri Nouwen, St. Pio, and more! Also, lots of
new jewelry items from the Vatican Collection—these
make wonderful Christmas gifts. Plus prayer books,
missals, and missalettes for the coming year 2015.</p>
<p><b>OUR ADVENT COMMUNAL RECONCILIATION SERVICE</b>
will be held Monday, December 15 at 7:30pm. During
this beautiful service of readings, reflection and song,
we will open ourselves to experience the gift of God’s
gracious and loving forgiveness in the Sacrament of
Penance. It has long been a tradition in the church to
confess one’s sins before celebrating the great feast of
Christmas. This will be the ideal time to do so.</p>
<p><b>WINTER SHELTER IN NEED OF SUPPLIES</b>. Thank you
for your generous support of the overflow Winter
Shelter! We currently are running low on the following
items: cough drops, disposable razors, lip balm, dental
floss, men’s deodorant sticks, large spray deodorant,
travel size non-alcohol mouth wash, and nail clippers/emery boards. Please drop off any supplies in the
Rubbermaid container at Coffee Hour after the 8am,
10am, and noon Masses, or at the Cathedral office
Monday-Friday 9am-5pm. Thank you!</p>
<p><b>CELEBRATING SANTO NIÑO</b>. The Cathedral Friends of
Santo Niño invite you to join them in planning the fiesta
celebrating the Child Jesus which takes place each
January after the Santo Niño Mass. You are invited to a
planning session during Coffee Hour in Cathedral Place
Hall on Sunday, December 14 following the Noon
Mass. Bring your ideas and enthusiasm! No experience
required!</p>

<p><b>TOY DRIVE FOR MIGRANT CHILDREN</b>. We are
collecting toys (new and gently used) for migrant
children in the Skagit Valley. Even if you didn’t
acquire a giving tree tag, you can still participate in
the effort! We especially need toy cars, trucks,
stuffed dolls, soccer balls, and other similar toys.
Donations can be brought unwrapped to coffee
hour or to the parish office during business hours.
Please help us make Christmas special for children
in need. We will deliver on December 20.</p>
<p><b>NICARAGUA MISSION TRIP</b> August 6-14, 2015.
Join us for a unique international experience
devoted to kinship and mutuality with orphaned
and abandoned children. We are joining forces with NPH USA, a national agency devoted to supporting
several orphanages in Latin America and the
Caribbean. NPH Nicaragua is home to 260 children
who are eager to connect with St. James youth,
including our two sponsored godchildren, Angel
and Shirley. We desire to learn from the poor, serve
alongside them, and return home transformed.

<p><b>SUNDAY EVENING ADVENT REFLECTIONS</b>.
Continuing TONIGHT, the young adults will meet
in the Rectory Parlors at 7pm on each Sunday in
Advent. Come for a quiet reflection on the meaning
of this season that is too often overlooked amidst
the busyness and consumerism of December. To
commemorate and learn from a time when the
Jewish people awaited the Messiah, we will explore
what it means to invite Christ into our lives today.
We will read scripture, listen to Franciscan priest
Richard Rohr, and discuss the implications for
everyday life. Light snacks will be provided.</p>
<p><b>GREENING OF THE CATHEDRAL</b>. On Monday,
December 22, there will be a rare opportunity to get

Volunteers are needed to decorate starting at

Space is limited—RSVP early!</p>
