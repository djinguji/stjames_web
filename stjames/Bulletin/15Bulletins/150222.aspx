<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the Cathedral,
we want you to know how welcome you are —
whether you have come from another part of the
country, from across the world, or simply from another
parish here in the Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the
generosity of visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the
Church’s liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are
also able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. </i> </p>
<p><strong>TELEPHONE SYSTEM HELP</strong>. The parish is evaluating an
upgrade for its telephone system and would welcome
assistance from a parishioner with expertise in this area.

<p><b>CATHEDRAL KITCHEN GARDEN</b>. It’s time to begin the
2015 growing season in our Cathedral Kitchen Garden.
We will kick off the year with a potluck dinner of
locally sourced foods on Friday, February 27, 6:00 pm
in the Pastoral Outreach Center. This potluck will be an
opportunity for us to renew relationships built in the
garden during the last growing season and create new
relationships with anyone who wants to volunteer in the
upcoming season. We will also lay out a plan for the
upcoming work parties, the planting, harvesting,
weeding and watering needs, and the evolving vision
for the garden as we work to bring healthy, locally
produced food to the guests of the Cathedral Kitchen.
Our first work party of the season will be March 14.
“Lettuce” rejoice and be glad as we gather for
fellowship and labor! <i>Information</i>,
