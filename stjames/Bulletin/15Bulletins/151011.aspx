visited a man in an addiction program and gave rent

Clutching our hands tightly, he burst forth with a
passionate prayer for himself, for us and for everyone
in his program who struggles with addiction and mental
health issues. He ended by asking God to “please bless
them all from the tops of their heads to the bottoms of
their feets.” Your support made this blessed moment
