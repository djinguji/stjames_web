<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James
Cathedral is proud to welcome visitors from
near and far throughout the summer months.
Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be
made from among all the visitor envelopes used. Please
write your address on the visitor envelope provided in
the pew and drop it with your offering into the collection
basket. Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer
by your presence in our midst today. Be sure to stop by
the <b>Cathedral Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection
of Cathedral souvenirs as well as books and gifts</i>. </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in loving memory
of Susan Snow on the fifth anniversary of her death.</p>
<p><b>AN INVITATION FROM OUR NEIGHBORS AT TEMPLE DE
HIRSCH</b>. Last April, the sacred space of Temple de
Hirsch Sinai was defaced by anti-Semitic graffiti. Rabbi
Daniel Weiner and the Temple de Hirsch community
will have a special service of rededication on Friday,
August 11 at 5:00pm. The short rededication service
will be followed by the Shabbat prayer and light
refreshments. All are welcome. The Temple is located
at 1511 E. Pike Street.</p>
	<p><b>HUNTHAUSEN AUCTION ON AUGUST 28</b>. The
Cathedral’s annual event benefiting the Cathedral
Kitchen is coming up on August 28. Would you
consider donating an item for the auction? We are
especially looking for bottles of wine and restaurant
gift cards. Other welcome items: hotel gift certificates,
Seahawks, Mariners, or Sounders tickets, sports
collectibles, theater/event tickets. You are also most
welcome to join us for golf or dinner! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b> for your donations, which fuel our home 
visits and enable us to help so many in need. Sometimes the person we are 
visiting gets something more from our visit that is just as important as 
financial help. Recently, we visited a woman who has been an in-home caregiver 
for over 30 years. Her kindness and skill were obvious, but she seemed 
physically and emotionally drained. We listened and then gave rent help, along 
with a few simple ideas on talking with her landlord and employers about the 
biggest problems she was facing. As we left, she finally smiled and then thanked 
us in the most heartfelt way for giving her “motivation and encouragement.” 
Thank you for helping us give the gift of hope! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>SHARE THE COMPASSION OF CHRIST</b>. Are you being

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL HELPLINE</b>. Facing eviction
because you cannot pay rent? Electricity being shut off
because you cannot pay your bill? Sleeping on the
floor because you cannot afford a bed? SVdP helps
residents in need with these and some of life’s other
necessities (like food, clothes, hygiene items). Request

<p><b>CATHEDRAL CHOIR PILGRIMAGE RUMMAGE SALE</b>.

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
“How can we genuinely teach the importance of
concern for other vulnerable beings, however
troublesome or inconvenient they may be, if we fail to
protect a human embryo, even when its presence is
uncomfortable and creates difficulties?” (<i>Laudato Si’</i>,
paragraph 120)</p>
<p><b>MISSIONARY DISCIPLESHIP FOR ADULTS</b>. Pope
Francis continually reminds us that we are called to be
missionary disciples in the world. On Thursday,
August 31, join other Cathedral parishioners in
learning more about the call to missionary
discipleship, through Scripture reflection, studying
Catholic Social Teaching, and serving the most
vulnerable in our community who come to the
Cathedral Kitchen. To learn more or to register for this
all-day offering, contact 
<a href="mailto:pbarredo@stjames-cathedral.org?subject=Missionary Discipleship for Adults">Patrick Barredo</a> (206-382-4515) or

NEWSLETTER AND FACEBOOK PAGE</b>. Towards the beginning of each month, the St.

	<p><b>CREATING PEACE IN OUR WORLD</b>. St. James is in the process of 
	forming a ministry to foster peace in ourselves, in our community and in our 
	world. Our next gathering will be on Tuesday, August 15 at 6pm in the 
	Pastoral Outreach Center. To learn more, contact

<p><b>REFLECTION ON HOMELESSNESS</b>. One of our
parishioners who is a member of the St. James
Housing Advocacy Committee regularly visits a
homeless encampment near her home. She drops off
sandwiches and warm clothes, after which, she says, “I
get in my warm car and drive away in the cold rain,”
grateful for the many blessings she enjoys in her own
life. Recently, she decided to stay and get acquainted
with some of the people in the camp. Contrary to the
disdainful remarks she often hears about people
experiencing homelessness – “lazy”, “alcoholics”,
“losers” – she meets families, like the one from New
Mexico who moved to Seattle searching for work, only
to find there were no jobs. Faced with a prohibitive
cost of living, they became homeless. The St. James
parishioner also met a Seattle woman with two young
children who lost her job, and then her apartment.
Many of the people in the encampment had never
experienced homelessness before, and never even
contemplated the possibility that they would find
themselves living in a tent. Most are determined to do
whatever it takes to find work and settle into a real
home. The parishioner left that day with a new sense
of urgency, and a determination to advocate with
compassion for those in our community who
experience homelessness.</p>
<p><b>NPH NICARAGUA STOCKHOLDERS DINNER</b>. Thanks to
all who made the Youth Ministry trip to NPH
Nicaragua such a great success. We’d like to share our
gratitude by inviting you to a dinner, slide show and
youth reflections on our trip. This will take place next
Sunday, August 6 at 6:30pm. Please RSVP to Curtis if
you plan to be there. Welcome to stockholders and
interested parishioners alike!</p>
<p><b>CALLING ALL SENIORS!</b> You are cordially invited to an afternoon of 
socializing, games, and ‘Create Your Own’ Ice Cream Sundaes! Wednesday, August 
2, 1:00-3:00pm. Join us on the Outdoor Patio of the Pastoral Outreach Center, 
corner of 9th Ave and Columbia Street. (In case of rain the event will take 
place in the Holy Names Room.) Enjoy the company of others as you play games and 
have a delicious summer treat! RSVP
