Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

procession with the lighting of the dedication candles.
All are welcome!</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a single mom whose health is 
rapidly failing. She has very little income, so we gave her grocery store gift 
cards to buy food for her special dietary needs. Later, she called to say that 
she and her young son had decided to thank us by contributing to the current 
sock drive at St James, and they were excited to have found a way to help the 
homeless. Your support made all these gifts possible – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

PROGRAM</b>. Over the next several
months, the cathedral will roll
out a new ministry called
PREPARES, an acronym for
Pregnancy and Parenting
Support. Through the unified
efforts of the Catholic
community in Washington State,
PREPARES offers pregnant
women and their families
unconditional, safe, and
nurturing care from pregnancy
through the child’s fifth
birthday. PREPARES responds to our Catholic
teachings on the preferential option for the poor
and respect for human life by training parish
volunteers to walk in compassion and solidarity
with low-income families as they face the
challenges of providing a nurturing home for their
children. Prepares is a comprehensive initiative
that includes all the works of our Catholic
community: Catholic parishes, Catholic Charities,
Catholic Health Care, Catholic schools, Catholic
organizations, and every ministry committed to
life and justice. Stay tuned! <i>Information</i>,
