		Dear Friends,<p>This weekend, we mark Earth Day on
April 22. As people of God, it is our duty to
work to become better stewards of the Earth.
In Pope Francis’ message to mark last year’s
World Day of Prayer for the Care for
Creation, he wrote that, “It is also
encouraging that throughout the world…
initiatives promoting environmental justice,
concern for the poor and responsible social
commitment have been bringing together
people, especially young people, from
diverse religious backgrounds. Christians or
not, as people of faith and goodwill, we
should be united in showing mercy to the
earth as our common home and cherishing
the world in which we live as a place for
sharing and communion.”</p>
<p>Next Sunday, our Care for Creation
committee invites all of us to an
Environmental Fair in Cathedral Hall. Let’s
take this opportunity to learn ways we can
be more mindful of how our everyday
actions affect God’s Creation, and urge
businesses and our lawmakers to also treat
the Earth with respect and mercy.</p>
