<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>
<p><b>PARENT’S FAITH FORMATION CONTINUES TODAY</b>. While your children are in 
their Faith Formation classes, join other parents for coffee, community and 
faith.

Rosanne Michaels</a>, 206-654-4658.</p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>, open after all weekend
Masses, features contemporary and classic Catholic
spirituality, missalettes, Bibles, children’s books,
rosaries, medals, and gift items. DVDs of the Christmas
Mass are available for a short time. Also, stop by and
take a look at our titles for Black History Month.</p>
<p><b>THREE WALKING PILGRIMAGES</b>. Jan Vallone Roberts,
will provide an overview of Catholic pilgrimages and
her recent experiences in Spain and Italy. Sunday,
February 12, 1:15 pm, Mother Mary Rose Room,
Pastoral Outreach Center.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL BELLS</b>. You may notice that the Cathedral
bells may not be ringing at the normal times on
weekdays the next couple of weeks. We are in the
process of power washing the upper areas of the towers
and ringing the bells in the proximity of workers could
constitute a safety hazard. We anticipate returning to the
regular bell schedule shortly and having some newly
cleaned towers to go with them!</p>
<p><b>SEATTLE PRO MUSICA CONCERT</b> Saturday, February 25
and Sunday, February 26 at 8:00 pm. This concert of
sacred music for choir and organ explores the theme of
liberation, expressing the desire of humankind to seek
social justice and peace. Leonard Bernstein’s beloved <i>Chichester Psalms</i> speaks eloquently of humanity’s
capacity for compassion and tolerance. Scottish
composer James MacMillan’s riveting and deeply
moving <i>Cantos sagrados</i> draws on Latin American
poetry and addresses contemporary humanitarian issues.

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. On a recent
afternoon, we made two separate home visits to two
people who do not know each other but called the SVdP Helpline (206-767-6449) for the same reason:
Both were the victims of identity thieves. One (a home
care worker) had about $500 stolen from her checking
account, and the other (a disabled senior) had over
$900 stolen from her Social Security EBT card. As a
result, neither could pay rent while they waited for
police and other governmental authorities to sort
through the financial mayhem. We helped pay rent and
admired their positive attitudes in the face of such
misfortune. Your support made SVdP’s help possible –
thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ONLY AMAZEMENT KNOWS: AN ASTROPHYSICIST ON
THE BEAUTY OF THE COSMOS</b> Thursday, February
16, 7:00pm, Wyckoff Auditorium, Seattle University.
Fascination with the moon and the stars is documented
at every stage of human history. In the last century,
tremendous advances have improved our
understanding of the evolution and content of the
Universe. And yet, the same wonder and sense of
mystery that drove the builders of Stonehenge is still
very much a driver of modern research. In this talk,
Dr. Maria Elena Monzani will share her experience as
an astrophysicist looking for one of the most elusive
components of the Universe, Dark Matter.</p>
