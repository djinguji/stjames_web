<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>
<p><b>ON THE COVER</b>. The Christmas Crib, St. James
Cathedral Chapel. This is the last day to visit!</p>
<p><b>HELP SYRIAN REFUGEES</b>. Stop by the coffee cart
during coffee hour after mass on January 8 and
January 15. The coffee cart will be collecting
donations that will be distributed to local Syrian
refugees. Needed items include clothing and blankets,
hygiene products, and school supplies. Cash donations

<p><b>SANTO NIÑO CELEBRATION</b>. On Sunday, January 15 at
the Noon Mass, we will celebrate the Santo Niño—the
Holy Child Jesus. All are invited to bring their own
images of the child Jesus from home for the blessing. A
wonderful fiesta follows in Cathedral Place Hall.</p>

<p><b>THE SEARCH FOR ENOUGH: A MEN'S DAY OF
REFLECTION</b> Saturday, January 28, 9am – 3pm in the
Pastoral Outreach Center. As the new year begins, give
yourself the gift of time to sift through what's most
important in life. Presenter Mike Schut will help you
explore the themes of scarcity and abundance in your
life commitments and relationships, and in a modern
economy. Sponsored by the Ignatian Spirituality Center. COST: $45 includes 
breakfast, snacks and lunch. Scholarships available.

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a young man living in 
subsidized housing who was not taking advantage of discounts on utilities, 
medical treatment and health insurance available to him because of his low 
income. He asked us to start paying part of his rent on an ongoing basis so that 
he could pay some anticipated medical bills. We gave him rent help on a one-time 
basis (we cannot afford to help every month), encouraged him to apply for 
discounts to which he is entitled and referred him to other money-saving 
programs. Your support made this potentially life-changing visit possible–thank 
you! <i>Information</i>,

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>On this Epiphany Sunday when we
celebrate the gifts the wise men brought to the
Holy Family, I want to take one more
opportunity to thank you for the incredibly
generous gift you made to the Hunthausen
Fund at the time of my 50th anniversary
celebration last month. You set out to raise
$50,000. Would you believe that, at this point
over $177,000 has been contributed to the
Hunthausen Fund? What an unbelievable
testament that is to your generosity. Frankly, it
leaves me speechless. All I can think of is all
the families who—thanks to you--will be able
to move from shelters to permanent housing. Thank you with all my heart!</p>
<p>Father Ryan</p>
