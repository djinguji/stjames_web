<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<b>FOR YOUR SAFETY</b>. At each of the weekend Masses a Seattle police officer 
is present on the Cathedral campus. </td></tr></table>
<p><b>ON THE COVER</b>. During the month of November, when
we pray for our beloved dead, our bulletin covers
include the names of those who have left legacies large
and small to St. James Cathedral in their wills over the
past thirty years. Each year, bequests allow the
Cathedral to carry out its mission of prayer and service
here on First Hill.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered by a parishioner
in loving memory of her husband.</p>
<p><b>SEATTLE AND THE SAINTS</b>. After the 8:00am, 10:00am,
and Sunday Evening Masses today, you’re invited to
stop by the Reconciliation Chapel and see an exhibit of
items about Mother Cabrini (including letters of the
saint and a chair she used!). There will also be a “show
and tell” of souvenirs from last week’s Beatification of
Father Solanus Casey.</p>
<p><b>BYRD ENSEMBLE CONCERT—A CLASSIC CHRISTMAS</b>.
Saturday, November 25 at 8:00pm, join the Byrd
Ensemble or a festive Christmas program of traditional
carol arrangements by English composers. The
program features Benjamin Britten’s famous
<i>Ceremony of Carols</i>, Gustav Holst’s <i>Four Old English
Carols,</i> and traditional Christmas carols for your family
to enjoy! <i>Information and passes</i>,

<p><b>ADVENT CANDLES</b>. While supplies last! This Sunday,
November 26, after the 10 and Noon Masses, and at the
Advent Bazaar, the young women of our Jubilate!
Ensemble will be selling beautifully packaged Advent
candles to benefit their pilgrimage to Rome in Lent,
2018. Be sure to stop by and pick up a set of candles for
a good cause!</p>
<p><b>FIRST FRIDAY EXPOSITION AND HOLY HOUR</b>. On
Friday, December 1, Exposition of the Blessed
Sacrament will begin immediately following the 8:15am
Mass and continue until 1:00pm. Holy Hour, with
rosary, readings, hymns, and silent prayer, will begin at
12 Noon. All are welcome to this meditative prayer in
the presence of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament.</p>
<p><b>SCHEDULE FOR CHRISTMAS EVE AND CHRISTMAS</b>.
With Christmas Eve falling on a Sunday this year,
please note some changes to our schedule for Sunday,
December 24. The 8:00am and 10:00am Masses will
take place as usual. Note that these will be Masses for
the Fourth Sunday of Advent, NOT Christmas Masses.
<b>In order to prepare for the Christmas liturgies,
there will be no Noon Mass or Vespers on
Christmas Eve</b>. The Christmas liturgies will begin
with the 5:30pm Vigil Mass of Christmas on
December 24. The Mass of Christmas Night will
follow at 10:00pm. On Christmas Day, Masses will be
at 8:00am, 10:00am, Noon, and 5:30pm, with Vespers
of Christmas Day at 4:00pm.</p>
<p><b>MEDIEVAL WOMEN’S CHOIR CONCERT–NOWELL
SING WE</b> Saturday, December 9 at 8:00pm. With roots
in antiquity and beyond, winter celebrations have a
long history in European culture. Early Christians
chose a date close to the Roman festival of Saturnalia
to celebrate the birth of Christ, and by medieval times,
Christmas had generated an outpouring of music in
every European land. The Medieval Women’s Choir
provides a uniquely medieval musical celebration of
one of the most significant Christian holidays.

<p><b>CULTURAL COMPANIONS</b>. In partnership with a local
agency supporting refugees, we are seeking volunteers
to be cultural companions to visit refugee families 3-4
times per month for six months in order to practice
English, build friendship, explore the community
together, answer questions about life in America, and
offer support as families get settled into their new lives
here. <i>Information</i>,

Cathedral Kitchen and Winter Shelter, thank you for

<p><b>PHASE ONE OF THE REPAIRS AND RESTORATION</b> to
the towers has been completed. Our bells are back on

<p><b>WINTER SHELTER</b>. We are in urgent need for
volunteers who can stay overnight on Sundays or
Mondays. On those evenings, we welcome homeless
men 50 years old and over. Please also consider
supporting the Winter Shelter by donating spray cans

<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO IS OPEN</b> after the 10:00am
Mass in Cathedral Hall. All proceeds for November go
to the Cathedral Kitchen.</p>
<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
During chilly winter months wear an extra layer (or
two!) around the house and lower the setting on your
thermostat. This can preserve resources, reduce waste
emissions and save money. Installing a programmable
thermostat will allow you to automatically reduce
heating at night or at times when no one is home.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we pray for the parishes of St. Andrew in Sumner, St.
Francis Xavier in Toledo, and St. Barbara in Black Diamond.</p>
