<p>Dear Friends,</p>
	<p>Along with our Archbishop, Most Reverend J. Peter Sartain, I welcome you to St. James Cathedral on this wonderful feast of Christmas.
</p>
<p>For many of you, St. James Cathedral is your home. You are a member of this large and marvelously diverse parish. For others, celebrating Christmas at St. James is a long and cherished tradition; still others will be coming here for the first time. All of you are welcome! And I hope you will discover in this holy place what people have always discovered at St. James: a great cathedral alive with the presence of God and a vibrant community of people who not only pray together in this place, but also carry out an almost dizzying array of outreach ministries to the poor and needy of our city.</p>
<p>I never cease to marvel at how many people find a home here at St. James Cathedral and how many meet Jesus in this place. They meet him in the Eucharist that is celebrated here, in the Word that is preached here, in the community at gathers here and, day after day, they meet him in the poor people who have always found a home here — maybe the only place they can really call home.</p>
<p>Week after week, Sunday after Sunday, thousands of people gather here to pray and then go forth from this beautiful place to live their Christian faith. In welcoming you here today, I invited you to become part of this wonderful community, part of the life and mission of St. James Cathedral by joining us for Sunday Mass and, if possible, by involving yourself in one of the many ministries and activities that are the hallmark of this place. The pages which immediately follow in this booklet will give you some idea of what goes on at St. James Cathedral the other 364 days of the year.</p>
<p>Each Christmas we celebrate the wondrous mystery of a God who found a home among us poor humans, a home in our own flesh and blood. Ever since that world-changing event, Christmas has been not only a moment in the far-distance past, but an event in the present and a constantly unfolding mystery. What happened in a lowly stable in Bethlehem two-thousand years ago happens over and over again in our time as we open our lives, our hearts, and our homes to the God who takes delight in dwelling among the members of the human family.</p>
<p>May you and all your loved ones be touched by the great Mystery we celebrate this day; may the thousands of people throughout the region who will experience the Midnight Mass on KING-5 Television be uplifted by our prayer, and may the blessings of Christmas — deep peace, abiding love, and overflowing joy — by yours in abundance.</p>
<p>Sincerely in the Lord Jesus,<br>
