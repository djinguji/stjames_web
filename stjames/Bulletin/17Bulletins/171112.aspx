<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>
<p><b>ON THE COVER</b>. During the month of November, when
we pray for our beloved dead, our bulletin covers
include the names of those who have left legacies large
and small to St. James Cathedral in their wills over the
past thirty years. Each year, bequests allow the
Cathedral to carry out its mission of prayer and service
here on First Hill.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in loving memory
of Dave Perozek.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO IS OPEN</b> after the 10:00am
Mass in Cathedral Hall. All proceeds for November go
to the Cathedral Kitchen.
</p>
<p><b>PARENTS’ FAITH FORMATION</b>. Yes, Mom and Dad, these
sessions are for YOU! This week, join Nancy Granger,
our parish mental health nurse, to learn more about
mental health resources for children, teens and families.
Come to Room 206 of O’Dea High School from
11:05am to 11:40am on Sunday, November 19.
<i>Information</i>,

<p><b>THANKSGIVING DAY FOOD DRIVE</b>. As in years past,
please consider bringing donations of canned food to the
Thanksgiving Day Mass at 9:30am. Your generosity will
support Cathedral Kitchen and the Food Bank at St.
Mary’s. Thank you!</p>
<p><b>MORAL INJURY</b>. Like psychological trauma, moral
injury describes one’s immediate and long term
response to exposure to extreme and unprecedented life
experiences which go against deeply held moral beliefs.
Join us today, November 12, in the Holy Names Room
at 1:30pm for a presentation by retired Colonel, USAR, and St. Vincent de Paul 
Case Manager for Veterans Services, Roy Harrington. <i>Information</i>:

		Dear Friends,<p>As we prepare for this year’s Sacrificial
Sunday Giving campaign, I wanted to give you a
heads-up about an important change to giving at
St. James Cathedral. We are switching this year
to a new provider for online giving, Our Sunday
Visitor. The new system will not only make life a
lot easier for our bookkeeper, it will make life
easier for you, as it will allow you to login to
your own account, check on your giving, input
changed credit cards, and more. You’ll even be
able to make your monthly gift to St. Vincent de
Paul using your credit card…!</p>
		<p><b>In the coming week you will be receiving an
e-mail directly from Our Sunday Visitor inviting
you to set up an account. I hope you will do so!</b></p>
<p>If you do not receive the e-mail, you will
still be able to set up an account by visiting the
Cathedral website and following the links
provided. </p>
		<p>Thank you!</p>
