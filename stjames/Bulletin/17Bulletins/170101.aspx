<p><b>MINISTRY OF PRESENCE IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>. The
Year of Mercy has concluded, but the mercy continues!
Each weekday in the Cathedral, a volunteer sits at a
desk in the northeast corner of the Cathedral near the
Mary Shrine, available to answer questions, accept
prayer requests, and greet visitors who stop in between
1:00pm-4:00pm. It’s a quiet time to pray, read, and be
present to those who come to the Cathedral, often
people in need. If you’d like to spend one afternoon a
week in the Cathedral, we’d love to have you be a part
of this ministry. <i>Information</i>,

you, Pagliacci Pizza, for providing your delicious pizza
to our Cathedral Kitchen on Thursday, December 15.
With your help we served more than 180 dinner guests.
The Cathedral Kitchen also thanks Central Co-op
Market for the generous donation of meat. It has been a
helpful addition to our daily meals. We were able to

your generosity and help in feeding anyone in need.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>BAPTISM OF INFANTS & YOUNG CHILDREN</b> (under the
age of 7) is celebrated monthly at one of the weekend
Masses. To prepare for this most important sacrament,
parents and godparents participate in a series of classes
to update their understanding of baptism, to reflect on
their responsibility to guide their children in the
practice of the faith, and to learn about the many ways
our parish supports families. Please allow at least two
months for preparation. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>BOOK GROUP</b>. If you’re in church on a Sunday,
odds are you’re going to hear something from the
writings of St. Paul of Tarsus. We know more
about Paul from his beautiful—at times, biting—letters than any other early Christian. So why not
resolve to learn a bit more about this complex,
dynamic and ever-controversial missionary and
saint over the next weeks? Together we’ll read and
discuss Professor Thomas H. Tobin’s <i>The
Spirituality of Paul</i>. Our first discussion will be on
Monday Jan. 30 at 7pm. Books may be purchased
from Curtis on sliding scale of $10-$20. Get you
copy today!</p>
<p><b>TAIZE PRAYER AND SIMPLE SUPPER</b> this Friday,
January 6. At the end of this contemplative,
communal prayer, we’ll cross Columbia Street to
share a simple meal in the Pastoral Outreach
Center.</p>

PROGRAM</b>. 
		<p>Over the next several
months, the cathedral will roll
out a new ministry called
PREPARES, an acronym for
<b>Pre</b>gnancy and <b>Pare</b>nting
<b>S</b>upport. Through the unified
efforts of the Catholic
community in Washington State,
PREPARES offers pregnant
women and their families
unconditional, safe, and
nurturing care from pregnancy
through the child’s fifth
birthday. </p>
		<p>PREPARES responds to our Catholic
teachings on the preferential option for the poor
and respect for human life by training parish
volunteers to walk in compassion and solidarity
with low-income families as they face the
challenges of providing a nurturing home for their
children. PREPARES is a comprehensive initiative
that includes all the works of our Catholic
community: Catholic parishes, Catholic Charities,
Catholic Health Care, Catholic schools, Catholic
organizations, and every ministry committed to
life and justice. Stay tuned! <i>Information</i>,
