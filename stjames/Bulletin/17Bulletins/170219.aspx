<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>, open after all weekend
Masses, features contemporary and classic Catholic
spirituality, missalettes, Bibles, children’s books,
rosaries, medals, and gift items. DVDs of the Christmas
Mass are available for a short time. Also, stop by and
take a look at our titles for Black History Month.</p>
<p><b>SEATTLE PRO MUSICA CONCERT</b> Saturday, February 25
and Sunday, February 26, 8:00pm.In our current climate
of conflict and division, Seattle Pro Musica presents a
concert on the theme of compassion and tolerance,
expressing the desire of humankind to seek social justice
and peace. This program centers on Bernstein’s beloved
<i>Chichester Psalms</i> for choir, harp, organ and percussion.
This will be paired with James MacMillan’s deeply
moving <i>Cantos Sagrados</i> on Latin American liberation theology poetry, 
addressing contemporary issues of political repression and the disappearances of 
political prisoners in Latin America. The message of peace, and of remaining 
vigilant in the struggle for social justice and human rights is more timely now 
than ever.

<p><b>ATTENTION, PARENTS</b>. On March 12, 2017, Children’s Faith Formation and the Youth Ministry
will offer one sexual abuse prevention course to the
children and youth who participate in those
programs. In our efforts to protect our vulnerable
population, the Archdiocese of Seattle has
integrated abuse prevention material into our faith
formation and youth ministry curriculum in the
context of teaching our youth about our Catholic
faith. To help you understand what your youth will
be offered, we ask you to visit: 
<a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.seattlearchdiocese.org/SEP/faithformation.aspx">http://www.seattlearchdiocese.org/SEP/faithformation.aspx</a>. This will provide you with
“Parent/ Guardian Resources,” to inform you about
the curriculum being used while also making
available the actual lessons. As the guardian, you
have the right to opt your child/youth out of this
lesson. You may do so by clicking on the link
“Opting Out.” You will need to fill this form with
your Catechetical Leader. This announcement is to
notify you of our new initiative to provide abuse
prevention curriculum to our youth in Faith
Formation/Youth Ministry. Unless you would like
to opt your youth out of this lesson you are not
required to do anything. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A disabled man
who was about to undergo knee replacement surgery
called the SVdP Helpline (206-767-6449) to ask for a bed. He could not afford to 
buy a bed, and all he had to sleep on was an air mattress. We had a new bed 
delivered to his apartment in less than a week. Later he told us his surgery 
went well and the bed we provided helped his recovery go more smoothly and be 
less painful. Your support made a tangible difference in this man’s life – thank 
you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>CRS RICE BOWL</b>. In two weeks, the Church invites us
as a People of God to once more encounter Lent, a
time of spiritual growth through prayer, fasting and
almsgiving. We are given forty days of opportunity to
encounter ourselves, our neighbors and our God anew.
And, on Easter Sunday, we encounter the Risen
Christ—and the hope that the Resurrection brings. Are
you ready for this journey? Catholic Relief
Services’ (CRS) Rice Bowl wants to accompany you
throughout these forty days with stories, prayers,
reflections and faith formation. Get started now by
downloading the app for Android and iPhone users and
setting a daily reminder to pray with it each day. How
will you use this Lent as a time to build a culture of
encounter—both in your local community, and in our
global one?</p>
<p><b>WELCOMING THE STRANGER IN YOUR MIDST</b>. Mark
your calendar for Thursday, March 9, 6:30-8:00pm, in
the Mother Cabrini Room. Learn how you can share
your time and talents in welcoming immigrants and
refugees. At St. James Immigrant Assistance
volunteers provide one-to-one tutoring in English and
Citizenship Preparation, serve on our advisory board,
assist with legal services, promote Elder Integration,
and provide office support. <i>Information</i>,
