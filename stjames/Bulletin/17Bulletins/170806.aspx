how welcome you are – whether you have
come from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, to
register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday Help
Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person will be
on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Awhile back, we visited a young mom of 
two small children, struggling to make ends meet with only a low-wage job, food 
stamps and grandma to babysit while she was at work. She started to cry, saying 
she was embarrassed as she never saw herself as someone who would have to ask 
for help. We assured her that many of us go through hard times but, thanks to 
the generosity of our parishioners, we are able to help. We’ve visited her a 
couple times since then, watching as she got a raise and promotion but then – 
just as things were looking up – she was laid off. For many we visit, life is a 
journey filled with obstacles. Thank you for walking with us on these journeys – 
your support makes such a difference! <i>Information</i>,
