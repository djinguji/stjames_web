<b>ATTENTION, PARENTS</b>. On March 12, 2017, Children’s Faith Formation and the Youth Ministry

<p align="center"><b>Campaign planning study announcement</b></p>
<p>Over the last several years it has become
apparent that the archdiocesan priest pension
and post-retirement medical plans are seriously
underfunded. Similarly, our women religious
must rely on dwindling resources within their
own communities to meet their retirement
needs. In addition, parishes have their own
needs to address.</p>
<p>At the recommendation of the Archdiocesan
Finance Council and in dialogue with the
Presbyteral Council, the Priest Pension Board
and other leadership, Archbishop Sartain has
decided to explore the possibility of a major
campaign to address the retirement needs we
face today and are projected to face in the
future, as well as local parish needs.</p>
<p>This planning study is an assessment to
gauge support for a major campaign to address
some or all of our identified priorities. The
study is being administered by outside counsel,
the Steier Group, a Catholic development firm.
They will survey the entire archdiocese to
determine which of our needs are deemed most
urgent by parishioners, and identify potential
support of a major campaign.</p>
<p>All parishioners are invited visit the
Archdiocese of Seattle’s website to learn more
about the study’s proposed goals and
participate in the study.</p>
<p>To participate in this important study, please
go online to www.seattlearchdiocese.org and
click on the “Planning Study Survey” link under
the Archdiocesan Events and Activities section
