<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>
<p><b>ON THE COVER</b> North transept stained-glass window.
Via, the Way. Charles Connick, artist.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in thanksgiving
for the ministry of Father Ryan, from Lisa and Michael
Forbes.</p>
<p><b>CHILDREN’S PROCESSION</b> at the beginning of the
Noon Mass today. Meet in the West Vestibule at 11:50.
Parents, please accompany very young children.</p>
<p><b>ROSARY</b>. All are welcome to join with a group of
parishioners who pray the rosary together in the Chapel,
Monday through Saturday at 7:40am.</p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>, open after all weekend
Masses, features contemporary and classic Catholic
spirituality, missalettes, Bibles, children’s books,
rosaries, medals, and gift items. DVDs of the Christmas
Mass are available for a short time. Also, stop by and
take a look at our titles for Black History Month.</p>
<p><b>MUSIC FROM MEDIEVAL SPAIN THIS WEEKEND</b>. At the
Sunday 5:30pm Mass on February 26, a group of
singers led by instrumentalist Shira Kammen will sing
music from the late 14th-century manuscript <i>Llibre
Vermell de Montserrat</i>, “Red Book of Montserrat.” The
songs in the book are devotional prayers to Mary that
were sung by pilgrims who kept watch at night in the
church of the Blessed Mary of Montserrat. Shira will
play a medieval bowed string instrument called a <i>vielle</i>,
which was a precursor to the modern violin.</p>
<p><b>SEATTLE PRO MUSICA CONCERT</b> Saturday, February 25
and Sunday, February 26, 8:00pm.In our current climate
of conflict and division, Seattle Pro Musica presents a
concert on the theme of compassion and tolerance,
expressing the desire of humankind to seek social justice
and peace. This program centers on Bernstein’s beloved
<i>Chichester Psalms</i> for choir, harp, organ and percussion.
This will be paired with James MacMillan’s deeply
moving <i>Cantos Sagrados</i> on Latin American liberation theology poetry, 
addressing contemporary issues of political repression and the disappearances of 
political prisoners in Latin America. The message of peace, and of remaining 
vigilant in the struggle for social justice and human rights is more timely now 
than ever.

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a man
who was recently released from prison after serving a
long sentence. While there, he was taught to crochet. It
is now his favorite pastime, and the handiwork he
showed us displays skill, artistry and joy. All the hats,
scarves, toys for children and other items the prisoners
crocheted were donated to charity. Now this man
dreams of “giving back” by continuing to help others,
even while he struggles to adjust to life outside prison
walls. All he needed from SVdP was a little help with rent, and your support 
made that possible – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

United States—in a life-changing Lenten journey of
encounter with the Catholic Relief Services (CRS)
Rice Bowl. Pick up your family’s CRS Rice Bowl on

<p><b>40 DAYS FOR LIFE</b> is an international, ecumenical,
campaign of prayer to end abortion, taking place in
675 cities of 40 nations throughout the
world. Participants are encouraged to engage in prayer,
fasting, and community outreach, while maintaining a
peaceful, prayer vigil in front of an abortion facility.
The spring campaign runs from Ash Wednesday,
March 1st, through Palm Sunday, April 9. In Seattle,
the vigil will be held 7:00am to 7:00pm on the public
sidewalk in front of Planned Parenthood at 2001
Madison. The goal is to have at least two persons
engaged in prayer—not demonstrations—during each
two-hour shift. A kick-off event will be held Sunday,
February 26 from 2:00 to 4:00pm at the Greenlake
Guest House, 1911 N. 63rd St. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ATTENTION, PARENTS</b>. On March 12, 2017, Children’s Faith Formation and the Youth Ministry
will offer one sexual abuse prevention course to the
children and youth who participate in those
programs. In our efforts to protect our vulnerable
population, the Archdiocese of Seattle has
integrated abuse prevention material into our faith
formation and youth ministry curriculum in the
context of teaching our youth about our Catholic
faith. To help you understand what your youth will
be offered, we ask you to visit:

lesson. You may do so by clicking on the link
“Opting Out.” You will need to fill this form with
your Catechetical Leader. This announcement is to

<p align="center"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy" size="5">Archdiocesan Planning Study</font></p>
<p align="center"><b>Campaign planning study announcement</b></p>
<p>Over the last several years it has become
apparent that the archdiocesan priest pension
and post-retirement medical plans are seriously
underfunded. Similarly, our women religious
must rely on dwindling resources within their
own communities to meet their retirement
needs. In addition, parishes have their own
needs to address.</p>
<p>At the recommendation of the Archdiocesan
Finance Council and in dialogue with the
Presbyteral Council, the Priest Pension Board
and other leadership, Archbishop Sartain has
decided to explore the possibility of a major
campaign to address the retirement needs we
face today and are projected to face in the
future, as well as local parish needs.</p>
<p>This planning study is an assessment to
gauge support for a major campaign to address
some or all of our identified priorities. The
study is being administered by outside counsel,
the Steier Group, a Catholic development firm.
They will survey the entire archdiocese to
determine which of our needs are deemed most
urgent by parishioners, and identify potential
support of a major campaign.</p>
<p>All parishioners are invited visit the
Archdiocese of Seattle’s website to learn more
about the study’s proposed goals and
participate in the study.</p>
<p>To participate in this important study, please
go online to <a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.seattlearchdiocese.org">www.seattlearchdiocese.org</a> and

the Archdiocesan Events and Activities section

<p><b>BAPTISM OF INFANTS & YOUNG CHILDREN</b> (under the

practice of the faith, and to learn about the many ways
our parish supports families. Please allow at least two
months for preparation. <i>Information</i>,
