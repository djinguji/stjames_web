<p><b>TODAY AT THE NOON MASS</b> we have the privilege of
celebrating with 30 young people as they receive the
Eucharist for the first time. So that they may focus on
the sacrament, please do not take pictures during the
Mass, or leave your seat while they are receiving
Communion. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p><b>ST. VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b> for making our
April 30 “Stuff the Truck” event a big success! We
filled the truck in only 3 hours, and SVdP had to bring a
second truck to pick up all the clothes, warm coats,
business suits, baby items, household goods, etc., you
gave us. Your generosity is amazing, and we thank you
for helping us help our neighbors in need. Thinking
about joining us? <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>SEATTLE PRO MUSICA CONCERT</b> Friday, May 19 and
Saturday, May 20 at 8:00pm – Ralph Vaughan
Williams’ <i>Dona nobis pacem</i> (Grant us peace).
Written between WWI and WWII, Vaughan Williams’
masterful anti-war cantata is one of the composer’s
best-known works. Scored for soloists, choir, and
orchestra, it is an impassioned plea for peace,
incorporating Biblical text with the emotionally
charged anti-war poetry of Walt Whitman, creating a
searing indictment of the tragedy of war. <i>Information

parish and find ways to meet fellow parishioners and
form community here? The best way to do that is by
getting involved in one of our many ministries!
<br>
		Here are some current opportunities.</i></p>

<p><b>MINISTRY OF PRESENCE IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>. Each
weekday in the Cathedral, a volunteer sits at a desk
in the northeast corner of the Cathedral near the
Mary Shrine, available to answer questions, accept
prayer requests, and greet visitors who stop in
between 1:00pm-4:00pm. It’s a quiet time to pray,
read, and be present to those who come to the
Cathedral, often people in need. If you’d like to
spend one afternoon a week in the Cathedral, we’d
love to have you be a part of this ministry.
<i>Information</i>,

Maria Laughlin</a>, 206-382-4284.</p>
<p><b>OPENING IN THE CATHEDRAL BOOKSTORE</b>. We are
currently looking for volunteers after the Saturday
evening Mass. The volunteer opens the bookstore
immediately following Mass and closes up about
7:00pm or 7:15pm. If you love books, holy cards,
and religious items, you’ll enjoy this ministry! All
training provided; background check required.

	<p><b>ROSARY</b>. All are welcome to join with a group of
parishioners who pray the rosary together in the
Chapel, Monday through Saturday at 7:40am.</p>
<p><b>BAPTISM OF INFANTS & YOUNG CHILDREN</b> (under the
age of 7) is celebrated monthly at one of the weekend
Masses. To prepare for this most important sacrament,
parents and godparents participate in a series of classes
to update their understanding of baptism, to reflect on
their responsibility to guide their children in the
practice of the faith, and to learn about the many ways
our parish supports families. Please allow at least two
months for preparation. <i>Information</i>,

<b>FOR YOUR SAFETY</b>. It is important for you to know that
at each of the weekend Masses a Seattle police officer
or a private security guard is present on the Cathedral
campus.</td></tr></table>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we pray for the parishes of St. Rita in Tacoma and
Sacred Heart in Battle Ground and Enumclaw.</p>
