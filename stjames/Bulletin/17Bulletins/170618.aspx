Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person

<p><b>CAMINO SEATTLE</b> begins today and continues through
July 23. Pick up your passport in the Cathedral
Bookstore or at the Sunday Help Desk and start walking!
It’s a wonderful opportunity to set aside some time
during Seattle’s beautiful summer days to walk and pray.
Keep an eye on the bulletin for special events in the
coming weeks. Our first two hosted walks will be on
Monday evening—Beacon Hill and Sunset Hill Park in
Ballard. Visit <a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/camino">www.stjames-cathedral.org/camino</a> for
details.</p>
<p><b>PRIEST DAYS</b>. From June 19-21, the priests of the
Archdiocese will be on their annual convocation. During
this time, we will celebrate the 8:15am Mass as usual but
we will not be able to have Mass at 5:30pm. The regular
schedule will resume on Thursday, June 22. Thank you
for your understanding.</p>
<p><b>RECEPTION FOR NEW PARISHIONERS</b>. Are you new to the Cathedral parish? 
On Monday, June 26 at 7:00pm in the Rectory Parlors, we will host a reception

ask questions, and enjoy a tour of the Cathedral. RSVP to

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b> for donating to
the special collection for SVdP this weekend, which
helps many of our neighbors in need. For example, we
recently helped pay the deposit on an apartment for a
middle-aged man and his elderly, disabled mom who
had been homeless, living in their vehicle for three
months. Your donations not only helped give them a
home but also relieved much of the heavy stress on
this caring son so that he can focus on his new,
full-time job, which will pave the way for them to leave
poverty behind. Your support of SVdP helps change
people’s lives—thank you! <i>Information</i>,
