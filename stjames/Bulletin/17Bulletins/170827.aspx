<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a
visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know
how welcome you are – whether you have
come from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, to
register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday Help
Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person will be
on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts</i>. </p>
<p><b>ON THE COVER</b> Jesus carries his cross. East Apse Stained
Glass Window. Hans Gottfried von Stockhausen, artist.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in loving memory
of Bunny and Dwight Devine from their children.
Flowers are also from the Saturday wedding of Michael
Gruber and Aliceanne Parker.</p>
<p><b>REGISTRATION FOR CHILDREN’S FAITH FORMATION
TODAY</b>. Come to Cathedral Hall after any of the Sunday morning Masses to sign 
your children up for grade-level and sacramental preparation classes. <i>
Information</i>,

<p><b>VAN DRIVERS NEEDED</b>. Our Sunday van ministry is an
important outreach to senior parishioners who would not
be able to get to 10:00am Mass on Sunday if it weren’t
for our drivers. It’s a simple but important way to reach
out to some of our senior parishioners! <b>Right now we
have a need for just one driver on the second Sunday
of the month</b>. All training provided; background check required. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>IS YOUR CHILD 5 YEARS-OLD?</b> Now is the customary
time to begin preparation for First Communion. Is your
child older? It’s not too late! Classes begin September 10.

<p><b>ARE YOU RAISING A CHILD WITH SPECIAL NEEDS?</b> The

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Make it a priority to increase your use of public
transportation. Buses and light rail are operating anyway,
so making use of them instead of your car -- even just two
or three times a month -- is a step in reducing emissions
and congestion. You might find it easy enough to do even
more often.</p>
<p><b>THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN THANKS</b> Pagliacci Pizza
for providing tasty pizza to our Cathedral Kitchen
guests on Thursday, August 17. With your help we
served more than 180 guests that day!</p>
<p><b>CLIMATE SCIENCE, <i>LAUDATO SI’</i> & THE NORTHWEST:
A RESPONSE OF FAITH FOR THE FUTURE</b> Thursday,
September 14, 7:00-8:30pm Wyckoff Auditorium,
Seattle University. Jeff Renner, meteorologist at KING
TV and member of Mary, Queen of Peace Parish in
Sammamish, will discuss the changes he has seen in
our climate, the latest science and the compelling call
of Pope Francis in <i>Laudato Si’</i> to Care for Our
Common Home.</p>

distant relationship? Think again! You can gain new

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A young man living in a large, recently 
renovated apartment building asked for rent help. During our visit, he kept 
scratching insect bites on his arms and legs. He said his bed was full of bed 
bugs and that many other tenants on the same floor had bed bugs, too. The other 
apartments had been treated and cleared of the bugs, but the landlord had not 
yet authorized treatment of his apartment. Bed bugs can spread quickly if left 
untreated. We gave the rent help plus advice on how to convince the landlord to 
get the apartment treated without further delay. Your donations enable us to 
help in many ways – with rent, perhaps a new bed (after bug problem is solved) 
and sometimes simply a bit of advice – thank you! <i>Information</i>,
