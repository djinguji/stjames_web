<p><b>WELCOME, VISITORS!</b> <i>If you are a
visitor to the Cathedral, we want you to know
how welcome you are – whether you have
come from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, to
register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday Help
Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person will be

<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in loving memory
of David Pettigrew from his family.</p>
<p><b>THE CATHOLIC CAMPAIGN FOR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT</b>
supports both national and local efforts to address the
root causes of poverty and to promote transformative
education. There are special envelopes for this important
cause in the pews in front of you. Please place them
along with your regular Sunday envelope in the
collection basket at the Offertory. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO IS UP AND RUNNING</b> after the
10:00am Mass in Cathedral Hall. All proceeds benefit the
ministries of St. James. Proceeds for September will go

FRANCIS</b>. Now and through October, stop in the Chapel
to view a series of paintings by Kathleen Frugé-Brown
exploring the life of St. Francis from the saint’s

<p><b>TALK ABOUT THE GOSPEL!</b> This year, the children of
our Faith Formation programs are focused on the
Bible. Watch this space in the bulletin each week for a
few questions you might want to use for a
conversation on the way home from church! This
week’s Gospel reading is Matthew 18:21-35. What
was today’s Gospel about? What do you think about
how the person in debt behaves? What does this story
tell us about the power of forgiveness? Can you think
of a time when you forgave someone “from your
heart”? How did that feel?</p>
<p><b>OUR CATHEDRAL YEAR OF THE BIBLE</b>. Join with the
families of Children’s Faith Formation in studying and
praying with the Bible this year. Sign up to receive a
weekly e-mail message with Bible tips, topics and
treasures for your family. Bibles for all ages are
available in the Cathedral Bookstore. <i>Information</i>,

community that also serves free meals to people living
on the streets. St. James Cathedral is responsible for
serving hot dinners at Nightwatch on the Second
Sunday of each month. Our volunteers serve from food
and clean up from approximately 8pm-10pm.

<p><b>THANK YOU FROM THE CATHEDRAL KITCHEN</b>. Thanks
to Seattle University’s Service Day faculty and staff

and Pantry on Friday, September 8. We really
appreciate all your hard work and our kitchen and

weekday in the Cathedral, a volunteer sits at a desk in
the northeast corner of the Cathedral near the Mary
Shrine, available to answer questions, accept prayer
requests, and greet visitors who stop in between
1:00pm-4:00pm. It’s a quiet time to pray, read, and be
present to those who come to the Cathedral, often
people in need. We are currently looking for
volunteers who might cover one Wednesday
afternoon each month, beginning in November.
