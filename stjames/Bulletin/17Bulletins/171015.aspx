<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a woman who recently had 
back surgery after suffering from back pain for many years. While she was in the 
hospital, a friend living in the same building entered her apartment daily to 
care for her tiny dog. On the night the woman returned home from the hospital, 
she woke up because multiple bed bugs were biting her. She then learned that 
other parts of the building were having a major bed bug infestation, and the 
friend had unknowingly brought bugs into her apartment. She had to throw out the 
futon she had been sleeping on. The good news is that your financial support 
bought her a new bed (after the bugs were cleared out), which is making her 
recovery from surgery much more comfortable – thank you!
