that they are working. On a 100 + year old building,
these things need attention every few years!</p>
<p><b>TALK ABOUT THE GOSPEL!</b> This year, the children of
our Faith Formation programs are focused on the
Bible. Watch this space in the bulletin each week for a
few questions you might want to use for a
conversation on the way home from church! This
week’s Gospel reading is Matthew 22:15-21. What
was today’s Gospel about? What does it mean to be a
good citizen? Jesus says, “repay to God what belongs
to God.” What does belong to God? What are some
ways we can give back to God?</p>

program features Anglican and Catholic motets by
Renaissance greats — Byrd, Palestrina, and Gibbons,
complemented by the Eastern style of Tavener,
Stravinsky, and Pärt. Despite the fact that the motets
were written over the span of 500 years, each one of
these masterpieces communicates a mystic and
profound spiritual mood. <i>Information and passes</i>,

residents of St James parish who struggle to pay for
life's necessities, such as rent, electricity, beds, food,
clothes and basic hygiene products. Your generosity is
great, but we are being asked for more help than we can
provide, especially as rents in our parish continue to
rise. That means we and those we serve are profoundly
grateful for every dollar you can spare for SVdP – thank you!
