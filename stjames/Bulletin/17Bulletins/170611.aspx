<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>
<p><b>ON THE COVER</b> <i>The Most Holy Trinity</i>. Joan Brand-Landkamer, Cathedral iconographer.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are the gift of Seattle
University in honor of the Class of 2017.</p>
<p><b>GUEST CHOIR SATURDAY 5:30PM</b>. We welcome the
choir of Holy Trinity Lutheran, Mercer Island, directed
by Chrade Younkin. They will sing an extended prelude
as well as Offertory and Communion motets, and a
postlude.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A middle-aged man
who lives near the Cathedral was riding the bus on his
way to start a new job as a maintenance worker. The bus
driver slammed on the brakes and the man was thrown to
the floor, breaking his wrist. Unable to work, he lost the
job and faced several weeks of no income before he
could even start looking for another job. He paid most of
his rent by using up his savings. With your support, SVdP helped with his rent and paid his water/sewer bill,
enabling him to keep his apartment and avoid a shutoff
of essential utilities – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>IMMIGRATION: WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHAT DO
YOU BELIEVE?</b> Immigration is a part of lives – in our
workplace, neighborhoods, and in our parish! How
does it effect you and what do you think about it? On
Monday night, June 12, the Cathedral will host a
Dialogue on Immigration. Any interested parishioner
is welcome to attend, but must register in advance.
This evening will not be a “town hall”, but rather a
chance to dialogue in small groups about what we
experience, think, and believe about immigration.
Please join us! Monday, June 12, 6:30-9pm in the
Isaac Orr Center, 910 Marion Street. To register,
please email your name to
