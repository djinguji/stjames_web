<p><b>TALK ABOUT THE GOSPEL!</b> This year, the
children of our Faith Formation programs are
focused on the Bible. Watch this space in the
bulletin each week for a few questions you
might want to use for a conversation on the
way home from church! This week’s Gospel
reading is Matthew 21:33-43.What was
today’s Gospel about? A “tenant” is a renter,
not an owner. Have you ever borrowed
something from someone? Did you take good
care of it? What do you think Jesus means by
the “vineyard”? What has God given to us to
take good care of?</p>
<p><b>95 FAMILIES HAVE REGISTERED THEIR CHILDREN
FOR FAITH FORMATION CLASSES</b>. It’s not too late to join them. <i>

<p><b>OUR ANNUAL MENTAL HEALTH AND
WELLNESS FAIR</b> will take place during
Coffee Hours following the 10am and Noon
masses on Sunday, October 8. Please drop by
to meet representatives from various service
organizations in our community.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A young
man who works for another charitable
organization that helps the homeless called the SVdP Helpline because he could not pay his
own rent. He had fallen behind when his
elderly parents in another state needed him for
a few months while his mom prepared for and
went through an organ transplant. Sadly, mom
died, dad had to move into assisted living, and
the young man found himself helping pay
their many unexpected expenses. When he got
back to Seattle, your support made it possible
for us to help pay his rent. Your support is
lightening his burden, making it so much
easier for him to focus on the job he loves:
helping the homeless. Thank you!
