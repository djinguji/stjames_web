begin to mark my body<br>
(and still more when they touch my mind);<br>
when the illness that is to diminish me<br>
or carry me off<br>
strikes from without or is born within me;<br>
when the painful moment comes<br>
in which I suddenly awaken to the fact<br>
that I am growing ill or growing old;<br>
and above all at that last moment<br>
when I feel I am losing hold of myself<br>
and am absolutely passive within the hands<br>
of the great unknown forces<br>
that have formed me;<br>
in all these dark moments, O God,<br>
grant that I may understand that it is you<br>
(provided only my faith is strong enough)<br>
who are painfully parting the fibers of my being<br>
in order to penetrate<br>
to the very marrow of my substance<br>
and bear me away within yourself.</font></p>

<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>
<p><b>ON THE COVER</b>. <i>The Sacred Heart Pleading</i>. South
transept, St. James Cathedral.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in memory of Elipidio Quiban.</p>
<p><b>GUEST CHOIR FOR SATURDAY 5:30 MASS</b>. We welcome
Les Petits Chanteurs de Monaco—Monaco Boys Choir—as the guest choir for the Saturday Vigil Mass this
weekend. Directed by Pierre Debat, the choir serves as
“little singing ambassadors” of the Principality of
Monaco. The boys range in age from 10-16 years old,
and participate in a rigorous choir training program
throughout the school year. They will sing the Kyrie and
Agnus Dei from R.R. Terry’s “Short Mass in C” as well
as Offertory and Communion anthems.</p>
<p><b>CAMINO SEATTLE WALK AFTER 10AM MASS</b>. Join us for
a Catholic History walk through First Hill and Central
District today, Sunday, July 9 at 11:15am. Starting from
St. James Cathedral's front steps, our walk will take us
past some of the Catholic institutions that have made
their mark on our city, including schools, parishes,
hospitals, and one important parish that no longer exists.
We will take a few short breaks for history tidbits along
the way. The walk will be just under three miles and will
last an hour. We will depart promptly at 11:15am.</p>
<p><b>TREASURES OF THE CAMINO</b>. As we prepare to celebrate
the Feast of St. James on July 23, a special exhibit in the
Reconciliation Chapel celebrates the Camino to Santiago
de Compostela—the great shrine of St. James in Spain.
Parishioners who have walked the Camino have shared
some photos and treasures from along the way. The
Reconciliation Chapel is located off the west vestibule of
the Cathedral and will be open before and after Mass so
you can view the exhibit.</p>
<p><b>CHAPEL CLOSED</b>. As Father Ryan mentioned in his letter
last week, the Cathedral Chapel is closed this month for
plaster work and painting. We apologize for the
inconvenience.</p>

<p><b>ATTENTION, GARDENERS AND GARDEN-LOVERS!</b>
We are hoping to form a small Cathedral grounds and
garden guild to assist our groundskeeper with the
upkeep of the Cathedral campus, including plantings
around the Cathedral and rectory. (<i>This is not part of
the Cathedral Kitchen Garden.</i>) If you enjoy working
outside and helping to make things beautiful, this may
be just what you’re looking for! We will kick off this
new ministry with a work party on Saturday, July 15,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Encourage prayer before and after meals to express
gratitude for God’s generosity in meeting our daily
needs. May your prayers also be a reminder of your

<p><b>REPORT FROM ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b>. Your SVdP
donations made it possible for our Cathedral
Vincentians to do 105 home visits during May & June
and help 140 low (or no) income residents of St James
parish who struggle to pay for life's necessities, such as
rent, electricity, beds, food, clothes and basic hygiene
products. Your generosity is tremendous, but more
people are asking us for help than we can handle,
especially as rents in our parish continue to rise. That
means we and those we serve are intensely grateful for
every dollar you can spare for SVdP – thank you! <i>Information</i>,
