<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I want to call your attention to the pages in this weekend’s bulletin
about a pilgrimage to Italy with the Cathedral Choir next Lent.</p>
<p>I look upon this pilgrimage as an invitation to beauty: beautiful <i>places</i>
(Rome, Florence, Siena, Assisi), beautiful <i>music</i> (who better to perform it than
our wonderful Cathedral Choir?), and, of course, joining the pilgrimage will
be some beautiful <i>people</i> from our parish.</p>
<p>How much beauty can you get? The combination should be
unbeatable!</p>
<p>The opportunity to pray with fellow parishioners in some of the great
churches and shrines of Italy will be a never-to-be-forgotten experience. Add
to that, the opportunity to hear great music – some of it actually composed for
those holy places -performed by the musicians of St. James Cathedral, and at
the conclusion of the trip, the chance to share in a Wednesday Audience with
Pope Francis, and you have the makings of a truly wonderful journey.</p>
<p>If you are in a position to make the pilgrimage, I encourage you to sign
up.</p>
<p>And for those of you unable to do so, we plan to provide ways for you
to be close to the pilgrims in prayer during those days of grace.</p>
<p>This will be a wonderful opportunity to grow in faith as a parish
community. Please consider joining us! Andiamo!</p>
