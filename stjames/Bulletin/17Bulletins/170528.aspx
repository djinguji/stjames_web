<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a man
whose tiny apartment had no furniture except a broken
couch. In the midst of an award-winning career as an
animal trainer, his life was shattered by severe injuries
in an accident, followed by a downward spiral that
culminated in over 2 years of homelessness. Now this
kind and gentle man is starting over with just a sweet
little dog for companionship – and a new bed from SVdP, thanks to your support!
