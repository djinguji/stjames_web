<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a family of four that needed 
help paying a utilities bill. The mother works fulltime, but the father was laid 
off his job. They received a water bill much higher than expected and could not 
afford to pay it. During our visit, we promised to pay the bill. When we later 
called to tell them the bill had been paid, the father told us that the little 
he had been able to save toward paying that bill could now be used to buy his 
children shoes. Your generous support makes a tangible difference in the lives 
of many in our parish–thank you! <i>Information</i>,

		<p><b>MINISTRY OF PRESENCE IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>.
The Year of Mercy has concluded, but the mercy

volunteer sits at a desk in the northeast corner of
the Cathedral near the Mary Shrine, available to
answer questions, accept prayer requests, and greet
visitors who stop in between 1:00pm-4:00pm. It’s
a quiet time to pray, read, and be present to those
who come to the Cathedral, often people in need.
If you’d like to spend one afternoon a week in the
Cathedral, we’d love to have you be a part of this
ministry. <i>Information</i>,
