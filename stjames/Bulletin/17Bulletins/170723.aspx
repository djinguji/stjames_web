<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James
Cathedral is proud to welcome visitors from
near and far throughout the summer months.
Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be
made from among all the visitor envelopes used. Please
write your address on the visitor envelope provided in
the pew and drop it with your offering into the collection
basket. Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer
by your presence in our midst today. Be sure to stop by
the <b>Cathedral Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection
of Cathedral souvenirs as well as books and gifts</i>. </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in loving memory
of Janet Ryan Pasha by a friend.</p>
<p><b>THE ART OF FAITH CAMP</b>. This weekend, we have the
opportunity to see the work of the youth who
participated in the Cathedral’s Art of Faith camp this
past week.</p>
<p><b>TREASURES OF THE CAMINO</b>. As we prepare to celebrate
the Feast of St. James on July 23, a special exhibit in the
Reconciliation Chapel celebrates the Camino to Santiago
de Compostela—the great shrine of St. James in Spain.
Parishioners who have walked the Camino have shared
some photos and treasures from along the way. The
Reconciliation Chapel is located off the west vestibule of
the Cathedral and will be open before and after Mass so
you can view the exhibit.</p>
<p><b>GATES FOUNDATION TOUR</b>. On Wednesday, July 26
at 11am, St. James Social Outreach and Advocacy is
sponsoring a tour of the Gates Foundation campus in
South Lake Union to learn about their work locally
and globally. If you are interested, RSVP at
<a href="mailto:outreach@stjames-cathedral.org?subject=Gates Foundation Tour">outreach@stjames-cathedral.org</a>

play a program of Bach, Marais, Isoir, Boulanger,

<p><b>AN INVITATION FROM OUR NEIGHBORS AT TEMPLE DE
HIRSCH</b>. Last April, the sacred space of Temple de
Hirsch Sinai was defaced by anti-Semitic graffiti. Rabbi
Daniel Weiner and the Temple de Hirsch community
will have a special service of rededication on Friday,
August 11 at 5:00pm. The short rededication service
will be followed by the Shabbat prayer and light
refreshments. All are welcome. The Temple is located

	<p><b>HUNTHAUSEN AUCTION ON AUGUST 28</b>. The
Cathedral’s annual event benefiting the Cathedral
Kitchen is coming up on August 28. Would you
consider donating an item for the auction? We are
especially looking for bottles of wine and restaurant
gift cards. Other welcome items: hotel gift certificates,
Seahawks, Mariners, or Sounders tickets, sports
collectibles, theater/event tickets. You are also most
welcome to join us for golf or dinner! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b> for your donations, which fuel our home 
visits and enable us to help so many in need. Sometimes the person we are 
visiting gets something more from our visit that is just as important as 
financial help. Recently, we visited a woman who has been an in-home caregiver 
for over 30 years. Her kindness and skill were obvious, but she seemed 
physically and emotionally drained. We listened and then gave rent help, along 
with a few simple ideas on talking with her landlord and employers about the 
biggest problems she was facing. As we left, she finally smiled and then thanked 
us in the most heartfelt way for giving her “motivation and encouragement.” 
Thank you for helping us give the gift of hope! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
“... In some places, where the facades of buildings are
derelict, people show great care for the interior of their
homes, or find contentment in the kindness and
friendliness of others. A wholesome social life can
light up a seemingly undesirable environment.” (Pope
Francis, <i>Laudato Si’</i>, paragraph 148)</p>
<p><b>SHARE THE COMPASSION OF CHRIST</b>. Are you being
called by God to bring a compassionate presence to
those in need? Are you interested in learning the
communication, and prayer skills that can increase
your effectiveness as a lay minister? Then Cabrini
Ministry Training is for you! Register now for our 6-month formation program that begins in October, or
for our 1-day “Accompaniment” Workshop scheduled
for Saturday, September 16. <i>Information</i>,

		<p><b>MINISTRY OF PRESENCE IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>. Each
weekday in the Cathedral, a volunteer sits at a desk
in the northeast corner of the Cathedral near the
Mary Shrine, available to answer questions, accept
prayer requests, and greet visitors who stop in
between 1:00pm-4:00pm. It’s a quiet time to pray,
read, and be present to those who come to the
Cathedral, often people in need. If you’d like to
spend one afternoon a month in the Cathedral, we’d
love to have you be a part of this ministry.
