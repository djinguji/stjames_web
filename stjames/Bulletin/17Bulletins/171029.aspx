<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in loving memory
of Dave Runkle, by his wife Liz, on the second

<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO IS OPEN</b> after the 10:00am

<p><b>ECUMENICAL VESPERS TODAY</b>. At 3:00pm, we will

solemn Vespers service, led by Archbishop Sartain with
Lutheran Bishop Kirby Unti. The service will feature
choir and orchestra and music from both the Catholic
and Lutheran traditions. All are encouraged to attend
this service of remembrance and reconciliation. Because
of this special service, we will not have our regular
4:00pm Vespers with Benediction today.</p>
<p><b>REMEMBERING OUR BELOVED DEAD</b>. You are invited
to write the names of deceased loved ones in the Book
of Remembrance which has been placed near the Shrine
of the Blessed Virgin Mary. This book will be carried in
procession at the solemn Requiem Mass of All Souls on
Thursday, November 2 at 7:30pm.</p>

All Saints. Masses for the Holy Day will be on

Noon. All are welcome.</p>
<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
“There is a nobility in the duty to care for creation
through little daily actions, and it is wonderful how
education can bring about real changes in lifestyle.
Education in environmental responsibility can
encourage ways of acting which directly and
significantly affect the world around us.” (<i>Laudato Si’</i>
211)</p>
<p><b>TALK ABOUT THE GOSPEL!</b> This year, the children of
our Faith Formation programs are focused on the
Bible. Watch this space in the bulletin each week for a
few questions you might want to use for a
conversation on the way home from church! This
week’s Gospel reading is Matthew 22:34-40. What
was today’s Gospel about? How does Jesus answer
the question about which commandment is the
greatest? How is loving our neighbor like loving God?</p>
<p><b>ADVENT BAZAAR</b>. The annual St. James Advent
Bazaar will be on Sunday, December 3, after the three
morning Masses (8am, 10am, 12noon) in Cathedral
Hall. If you are interested in being a part of the Bazaar
as a vendor, please contact

<p><b>CARE FOR CREATION SITE VISIT</b>. South Seattle Transfer Station,

join the St. James Care for Creation committee to learn how more than 320,000 
tons of garbage, recycling and yard waste are processed each year. We will be in 
the Viewing Room that overlooks the tipping floor so visitors can see the 
station’s daily operations. In addition, educational displays and videos explain 
Seattle’s solid waste system, including recycling and waste reduction. To join 
the tour, contact

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We recently
visited two middle-aged women who live in the same
large building but do not know each other. Each had
been homeless until about a week before our visits.
One is disabled, and the other works a seasonal job
with variable hours and inadequate pay. Both were
thrilled to finally have homes and very happy, even
excited, to get our help paying their rental deposits.
One had taken many photos of her tiny apartment on
the day she moved in. She showed them to us proudly,
and we were moved to see that the last photo showed
the apartment key sitting in the palm of her hand. At
moments like these, we feel Jesus in our midst, and we
thank you for your donations to SVdP, which make the help we give possible!
