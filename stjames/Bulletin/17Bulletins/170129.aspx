<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. A construction worker was unable to pay 
his rent after being injured and missing work for a couple weeks. He lives in a 
building where it is legal to evict with little advance notice. His landlord 
locked him out of his apartment, and he was spending nights walking around and 
napping at the airport rather than sleeping outside during the coldest winter 
weather. We helped cure the rent problem, and he is now back in his small but 
warm apartment. Your support literally put a roof back over this man’s head and 
gave him back his own bed to sleep in–thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR YOUTH</b>. You can have a
profound impact in the lives of teenagers charged with
an offense in Juvenile Court. St. James Cathedral's
Juvenile Justice Commission invites you to learn about
the traditional Court process, and about a new
opportunity for youth in King County to resolve
criminal conflicts using Peacemaking Circles, rather
than the traditional Court system. To learn how you
can help, please join us, as well as speakers from both
the Courts and the Peacemaking Circles, for one of
three introductory information sessions in the Mother

provide an overview of Catholic pilgrimages and
discuss her recent experiences walking two sections of

<p><b>SPIRITUALITY OF PAUL BOOK GROUP</b>. We hear
from Paul of Tarsus almost every Sunday of the
year, but how much do we really know about this

his letters today. We’ll be using Professor Thomas
H. Tobin’s accessible <i>The Spirituality of Paul</i> as a
jumping off point. Our first discussion will be on
Monday January 30 at 7pm. Books may be
purchased on sliding scale of $10-$20. Contact
