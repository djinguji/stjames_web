<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We often help cooks and waiters who 
work in restaurants where pay fluctuates as the number of hours worked goes up 
and down based on how busy the restaurant is. Recently we helped a waiter who 
has worked at the same restaurant over 15 years. The restaurant temporarily 
closed for at least a year for major remodeling, and his roommate (who paid half 
the rent) moved out at about the same time. We helped with part of a month’s 
rent, and his brother chipped in with the rest, which should buy the man time to 
find work elsewhere or at least begin receiving unemployment checks. Thank you 
for helping him keep his home during a time of great uncertainty, caused by 
circumstances beyond his control. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Pope Francis writes that the disappearance of an entire
culture “can be just as serious, or even more serious,
than the disappearance of a species of plant or
animal” (<i>Laudato Si’</i>, 145). We should strive to listen
to indigenous peoples, protect their lands and involve
them in processes and decisions that affect them.</p>
