<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how

world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

<p><b>BE A CHANNEL OF GOD’S PEACE</b>. The Cathedral is
forming an inquiry group to explore how St. James can
be a channel of peace for our community and for our
world. If you have ideas on how we can promote peace,
you are welcome to come join with others, including
leaders from Pax Christi, interested in building peace.
We will meet on Thursday, June 8, 6:30pm in the Mother

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Our Cathedral
Vincentians always try to be good stewards of the
generous financial donations received, and sometimes
the people we serve help us! For example, we recently
received requests for rent help from a man and a
woman in two separate apartment buildings on Capitol
Hill. Shortly before we started out to visit them, the
woman called to let us know that she had found help
elsewhere and that “someone else may need the help
more.” When we arrived at the man’s apartment, he
told us he felt he could come up with the money he
needed and that he wanted someone else to get our
help instead. Thinking about volunteering with SVdP? Visit our table after the 
10am Mass today or call

<p><b>IMMIGRATION: WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHAT DO
YOU BELIEVE?</b> Immigration is a part of lives – in our
workplace, neighborhoods, and in our parish! How
does it effect you and what do you think about it? On
Monday night, June 12, the Cathedral will host a
Dialogue on Immigration. Any interested parishioner
is welcome to attend, but must register in advance.
This evening will not be a “town hall”, but rather a
chance to dialogue in small groups about what we
experience, think, and believe about immigration.
Please join us! Monday, June 12, 6:30-9pm in the
Isaac Orr Center, 910 Marion Street. To register,
please email your name to

Community Services and other Catholic agencies. In
this new ministry, teams of parishioners will provide
unconditional, safe and nurturing care to pregnant
women and needy families through a child’s 5th
birthday. PREPARES puts in action our Catholic
teachings, calling us to respect all human life and to
observe a preferential option for the poor. A training
session for new volunteers has been scheduled for
Monday, June 19, 6:00-9:00pm in the Pastoral
Outreach Center at 907 Columbia. <i>Information and
