<p>Dear Father, Pastoral Coordinator:</p>
<p>With deep alarm we learned this morning of the cancellation of the DACA program and
a schedule to phase-out the program in the next six months, unless Congress acts to pass a
legislative solution. We want to express clearly at this time our concern for all the young people
– Americans – who are affected by this troubling decision. We know many “Dreamers” in
western Washington and admire the extraordinary contributions they are making to our
communities and the vibrancy of our parishes. To penalize them because they entered the
United States without documents as minors with their parents is unjust and does not reflect the
proud tradition of our country.</p>
<p>As Daniel Cardinal DiNardo, President of the United States Conference of Catholic
Bishops, said today, “These youth entered the U.S. as minors and often know America as their
only home. The Catholic Church has long watched with pride and admiration as DACA youth
live out their daily lives with hope and determination to flourish and contribute to society:
continuing to work and provide for their families, continuing to serve in the military, and
continuing to receive an education. Now, after months of anxiety and fear about their futures,
these brave young people face deportation.”</p>
<p>With Cardinal DiNardo and the excellent staff of the USCCB, we intend to strongly urge
Congress to pass a legislative solution that is humane and fair. Not to do so would be to turn
away from our very own sisters and brothers. We encourage all Catholics in western
Washington to let their voices be heard as well. Please refer to the Washington State Catholic
Conference’s (WSCC) action alert and add your voice to ours.</p>
<p>To our young friends who are fearful of deportation as a result of this decision by the
Trump Administration, we want you to know that we are with you, that we pray for you, and
that in the name of the Lord Jesus, we will do all we can to make the United States your
permanent home.</p>

<p><b>SEPTEMBER 10 IS WORLD SUICIDE PREVENTION DAY</b>.
The World Health Organization estimates that over
800,000 people die by suicide each year – that’s one
person every 40 seconds. Please take a moment to pray
for those who see no hope and all those impacted by

<p><b>TALK ABOUT THE GOSPEL!</b> This year, the children of
our Faith Formation programs are focused on the Bible—learning about it and learning to love it and pray with it.
Each week, watch this space in the bulletin for a few
questions you might wish to talk about on the way home.
This week’s gospel reading is Matthew 18:15-20. What
was today’s Gospel reading about? How does Jesus want
us to talk to someone who does something wrong? What
does Jesus say about the power of prayer? Who and what
do you want to pray for as a family?</p>
<p><b>COMPANIONSHIP TRAINING</b> with Kae Eaton,
Chaplain, Spiritual Director, and Executive Director of
Seattle’s Mental Health Chaplaincy will take place on
Saturday September 30, 9am–12pm in the Pastoral
Outreach Center. Learn how to demonstrate a
compassionate presence. This free morning workshop
provides a basic foundation for simple skills that can
guide us in our response to others. The teachings are
based on the work of Rev. Craig Rennebohm, author
of <i>Souls in the Hands of a Tender God</i> and founder of
the Mental Health Chaplaincy. Refreshments included.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a
couple who recently moved into a tiny apartment after
being homeless. They were new to the area and needed
our help with rent, which we gave. Very high grocery
bills was one reason they could not pay their rent.
They said they wanted to use free food banks but had
not yet found any in their new neighborhood. We gave
them a copy of the “green sheet” listing free food
banks, free meal programs (including the Cathedral
Kitchen) and other resources in our parish. They were
delighted to get this money-saving information. If you
know of someone who could use the “green sheet,”
pick up a copy from the wall pockets in the Cathedral
vestibules or in the Cathedral Bookstore. Your support
helps SVdP “spread the word” about so many local
resources that can help people in need – thank you!
