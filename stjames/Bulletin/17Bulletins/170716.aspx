<p><b>WELCOME, SUMMER VISITORS!</b> <i>St. James
Cathedral is proud to welcome visitors from
near and far throughout the summer months.
Each week a drawing for a special Cathedral gift will be
made from among all the visitor envelopes used. Please
write your address on the visitor envelope provided in
the pew and drop it with your offering into the collection
basket. Thank you for adding to the power of our prayer
by your presence in our midst today. Be sure to stop by
the <b>Cathedral Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection
of Cathedral souvenirs as well as books and gifts</i>. </p>
<p><b>ON THE COVER</b>. St. James Cathedral is depicted on a
utility box at 9th and Madison, part of a First Hill
beautification project. The artist is Nathan Watkins.</p>
<p><b>CHAPEL CLOSED</b>. The Cathedral Chapel is closed this
month for plaster work and painting. We apologize for
the inconvenience.</p>
<p><b>CAMINO SEATTLE ROSARY WALK AFTER 10AM MASS</b>.
Join us for a walk through First Hill and Central District
today, Sunday, July 16 at 11:15am. Starting from St.
James Cathedral's front steps, our walk will take us to
different images of Mary at Seattle University,
Immaculate Conception, and St. James Cathedral, and
we’ll pray a decade of the rosary at each stop. The walk
will be just under three miles and will last about an hour
and a half. We will depart promptly at 11:15am.</p>
<p><b>TREASURES OF THE CAMINO</b>. As we prepare to celebrate
the Feast of St. James on July 23, a special exhibit in the
Reconciliation Chapel celebrates the Camino to Santiago
de Compostela—the great shrine of St. James in Spain.
Parishioners who have walked the Camino have shared
some photos and treasures from along the way. The
Reconciliation Chapel is located off the west vestibule of
the Cathedral and will be open before and after Mass so
you can view the exhibit.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. In June, we visited a woman suffering 
from serious medical conditions and undergoing radiation. She and a friend were 
splitting the cost of a rental house, but the owner sold the house, so they had 
to move out and the friend moved away. The woman had just been approved to 
receive monthly Social Security Disability Insurance, but the payments would not 
begin until July. She was able to move into a small apartment but had no money 
to pay June rent. Another charity agreed to pay part but only if someone else 
would help, too. From your donations, we paid the gap on her June rent. Now she 
can focus on her health and not fear homelessness – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Talk with fellow parishioners about the possibility of
sharing rides to Mass and other parish events as a way
of reducing your carbon footprint. You can take this a
step further by organizing occasional walk-to-church
weekends. This would be a blessed opportunity to
extend the Camino experience!</p>

at 11am, St. James Social Outreach and Advocacy is
sponsoring a tour of the Gates Foundation campus in
South Lake Union to learn about their work locally
and globally. If you are interested, RSVP at
<a href="mailto:outreach@stjames-cathedral.org?subject=Gates Foundation Tour">outreach@stjames-cathedral.org</a> or 206-382-4515.
Limited transportation will be available from the
