<p><b>SEATTLE PRO MUSICA CONCERT</b> Friday, May 19 and
Saturday, May 20 at 8:00pm – Ralph Vaughan
Williams’ <i>Dona nobis pacem</i> (Grant us peace).
Written between WWI and WWII, Vaughan Williams’
masterful anti-war cantata is one of the composer’s
best-known works. Scored for soloists, choir, and
orchestra, it is an impassioned plea for peace,
incorporating Biblical text with the emotionally
charged anti-war poetry of Walt Whitman, creating a
searing indictment of the tragedy of war. <i>Information

	off my shoulders &amp; allowed me to focus on my chemotherapy treatments instead 
	of where I was going to live.” Your support means so much to those we help -

<p><b>THANK YOU FROM THE WINTER SHELTER</b>. Our
Winter Shelter is now closed for the summer. We were
open from September until this past April for 116
nights, and invited about 14 men each evening. That

50 into our midst. Thank you to all our volunteers who
made this happen! During the summer months, you
can still help out–while you are travelling, be sure to
pick up hotel toiletries and then drop them off at
