<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

<p><b>SANTO NIÑO CELEBRATION</b>. Today at the Noon Mass,
we will celebrate the Santo Niño—the Holy Child
Jesus. All are invited to the fiesta following Mass in
Cathedral Place Hall.</p>
<p><b>HELP SYRIAN REFUGEES</b>. Stop by the coffee cart during coffee hour after 
Mass. The coffee cart will be collecting donations that will be distributed to 
local Syrian refugees. Needed items include clothing and blankets, hygiene 
products, and school supplies. Cash donations are used for rent assistance. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>THE SEARCH FOR ENOUGH: A MEN'S DAY OF
REFLECTION</b> Saturday, January 28, 9am – 3pm in the
Pastoral Outreach Center. As the new year begins, give
yourself the gift of time to sift through what's most
important in life. Presenter Mike Schut will help you
explore the themes of scarcity and abundance in your
life commitments and relationships, and in a modern
economy. Sponsored by the Ignatian Spirituality Center. COST: $45 includes 
breakfast, snacks and lunch. Scholarships available.

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. In 2016, the SVdP
Helpline (206-767-6449) took more than 24,000 phone
calls from individuals and families in King County who
needed help paying for life’s necessities, like rent,
electricity, food, clothes and beds. Amazingly, SVdP (a
worldwide organization) would not exist but for the fact
that one day 400 years ago – in 1617 – St Vincent de
Paul begged his parish congregation to help a single
poor family in great need of food and spiritual comfort.
The parish answered Vincent’s call, and he realized that
many more people could be helped if properly
organized to work together for charity. When you
donate to SVdP in the special collection each month, you help our neighbors in 
need and you keep Vincent’s vision of charity alive – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

Studies at Rice University, Ken Cowan is one of
America’s most sought-after organists. Particularly
known for his performances of transcriptions, Mr.

James, he will present a variety of repertoire, including

<p><b>RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR YOUTH</b>. You can have a
profound impact in the lives of teenagers charged with
an offense in Juvenile Court. St. James Cathedral's

opportunity for youth in King County to resolve
criminal conflicts using Peacemaking Circles, rather
than the traditional Court system. To learn how you
can help, please join us, as well as speakers from both
the Courts and the Peacemaking Circles, for one of

his letters today. We’ll be using Professor Thomas
H. Tobin's accessible <i>The Spirituality of Paul</i> as a
jumping off point. Our first discussion will be on

<p><b>YOUTH MUSIC PROGRAM</b>. The spring semester of the
St. James Youth Music Program has begun! Do you
have a child who loves to sing or wants to learn?
Choral singing is not just about music - it builds social

Cantorum choir, for girls and boys ages 8-13, provides
the music at the noon “First Sunday Youth
Celebrations,” the 5:30 Christmas Eve Vigil, and
various archepiscopal liturgies. Jubilate!, the
Cathedral's ensemble for young women of high school
age, sings regularly at the noon Mass on the third
Sunday of the month as well as various special liturgies
and occasional Vespers. This year, Jubilate! will sing
the Stabat Mater by G.B. Pergolesi, with orchestra at
the Good Friday Tre Ore service. New choristers are
requested to complete a short interview to assess
musical aptitude – to schedule an interview, please call
