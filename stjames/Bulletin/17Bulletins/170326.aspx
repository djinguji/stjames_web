<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

<p><b>CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES COLLECTION</b>. This
weekend we take up our annual collection to support
Catholic Relief Services. Since 1943, CRS has been the
Catholic Church in America’s main agency for
providing relief to victims of war and natural disasters
as well as providing development and support services
for the disadvantaged throughout the world. There are
envelopes for this important cause in the pews and
chairs in front of you.</p>
<p><b>PARISH LENTEN RETREAT</b>. Helen Oesterle will lead us
in a Lenten Retreat, Saturday, April 1, from 9am&en;11am
in Cathedral Hall. The retreat is designed for those who

but all are welcome. This will be the perfect way to
prepare for our Lenten Communal Penance Services.

St. Therese (Madrona), St. Paul (Skyway), St. Edward
(Rainier Valley), St. George (Beacon Hill), St. Joseph
(Capitol Hill) and Holy Family (White Center/West
Seattle). If you are a registered parishioner at St. James,
your children can attend any one of these schools at the
‘in-parish’ tuition rate. And you may also be eligible
for tuition assistance. Also, thanks to the Simperman
Scholar program, the Cathedral is able to assist
parishioners with children attending any one of FOUR
Catholic High Schools: O’Dea, Holy Names, Bishop
Blanchet, and Kennedy Catholic. <i>For the requirements

<p><b>MINISTRY OF PRESENCE IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>. Each
weekday in the Cathedral, a volunteer sits at a desk
in the northeast corner of the Cathedral near the
Mary Shrine, available to answer questions, accept
prayer requests, and greet visitors who stop in
between 1:00pm-4:00pm. It’s a quiet time to pray,
read, and be present to those who come to the
Cathedral, often people in need. If you’d like to
spend one afternoon a week in the Cathedral, we’d
love to have you be a part of this ministry.
