<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>

<b>FOR YOUR SAFETY</b>. At each of the weekend Masses a Seattle police officer 
is present on the Cathedral campus. </td></tr></table>
<p><b>ON THE COVER</b>. During the month of November, when
we pray for our beloved dead, our bulletin covers
include the names of those who have left legacies large
and small to St. James Cathedral in their wills over the
past thirty years. Each year, bequests allow the
Cathedral to carry out its mission of prayer and service
here on First Hill.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in memory of
Irene Telmo on the 5th anniversary of her death, from
her son Edgardo. Flowers at the Shrine of the Blessed
Virgin Mary in the North Transept last Sunday were
offered in loving memory of Teresita Guerrero on the
first anniversary of her death.</p>
<p><b>CATHEDRAL ESPRESSO IS OPEN</b> after the 10:00am
Mass in Cathedral Hall. All proceeds for November go
to the Cathedral Kitchen.</p>
<p><b>THANKSGIVING DAY FOOD DRIVE</b>. As in years past,
please consider bringing donations of canned food to the
Thanksgiving Day Mass at 9:30am. Your generosity will
support Cathedral Kitchen and the Food Bank at St.
Mary’s. Thank you!</p>
<p><b>ADVENT CANDLES</b>. While supplies last! Next Sunday,
November 26, after the 10 and Noon Masses, and at the
Advent Bazaar, the young women of our Jubilate!
Ensemble will be selling beautifully packaged Advent
candles to benefit their pilgrimage to Rome in Lent,
2018. Be sure to stop by and pick up a set of candles for
a good cause!</p>
<p><b>THE ADVENT GIVING TREE</b> is now in the Cathedral (by
the Marion and Terry doors) and at Coffee Hour. This
week, there are tags for the PREPARES program,
working with young families in our area, and the Youth
Migrant Project, that works with migrant families in the
Skagit Valley. Take a tag, buy the gift, then return it to
the Parish Office, the Bookstore or at Coffee Hour.
Thank you for your generosity and spirit of giving!</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. Almost everyone
needs a little help sometime, but it can be hard to
swallow pride and accept help. Recently a sweet and
caring grandma who had herself been helped by SVdP
called the SVdP Helpline (206-767-6449) and asked us
to help her granddaughter and great-grandbaby as both
had been very sick. Grandma said they needed “some
good nutrition” that they could not get enough of at
their neighborhood food bank. We called the
granddaughter but she refused our help. We talked
with grandma again, knowing that grandmas can be
very persuasive. A few days later, the granddaughter
called us back and happily accepted our help, which
made us happy, too. Your donations make such help
possible – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
Save water by taking shorter showers and not letting
the water run continuously while brushing teeth or
shaving. In this way we can help bring a future in
which impoverished populations around the world will
have affordable access to a clean source of this God-given
necessity of life.</p>

<p><b>BYRD ENSEMBLE CONCERT—A CLASSIC CHRISTMAS</b>.
Saturday, November 25 at 8:00pm, join the Byrd
Ensemble or a festive Christmas program of traditional
carol arrangements by English composers. The
program features Benjamin Britten’s famous
<i>Ceremony of Carols</i>, Gustav Holst’s <i>Four Old English
Carols,</i> and traditional Christmas carols for your family
to enjoy! <i>Information and passes</i>,

<p><b>SAVE THE DATE FOR READINGS AND CAROLS</b>
Friday, December 15 at 7:30pm. In the soft glow of
candlelight, readings from Holy Scripture tell the
ancient story of Christ's birth. The Cathedral's youth
and adult choirs are joined by the Cathedral Brass
(including musicians from Seattle Symphony and
Pacific Northwest Ballet) and two organs to perform
jubilant music for the Advent and Christmas seasons.
