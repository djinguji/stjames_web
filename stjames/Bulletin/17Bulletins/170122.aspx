<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a middle-aged woman who 
recently got her own apartment after being homeless for a long time. Lacking a 
high school education and having few job skills, she has spent much of her adult 
life being treated like she isn’t worth much. But, with a new home to call her 
own, she had a bright smile on her face and a new attitude, saying “I’m not 
going to let nobody stop me!” She’s now working toward her high school diploma 
and starting to find occasional babysitting and other short-term jobs to cobble 
together a small income. We helped with food and basic household items. 
Otherwise, she told us she will be fine because “the Lord will provide.” Your 
support made our help possible–thank you! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>THREE WALKING PILGRIMAGES</b>. Jan Vallone Roberts,
known for facilitating writing groups at St. James, will
provide an overview of Catholic pilgrimages and
discuss her recent experiences walking two sections of
the Camino de Santiago in Spain and one section of
the Via Francigena in Italy. This informal presentation
will include many beautiful pictures and will provide
information and enjoyment for those contemplating a
walking pilgrimage, as well as for those who prefer
armchair traveling! Sunday, February 12, 1:15 pm,
Mother Mary Rose Room, Pastoral Outreach Center.
Coffee and donuts will be served!</p>
<p><b>CONFRONTING PORNOGRAPHY</b>. St. James has an anonymous support group for

<p><b>RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR YOUTH</b>. You can have a
profound impact in the lives of teenagers charged with
an offense in Juvenile Court. St. James Cathedral's
Juvenile Justice Commission invites you to learn about
the traditional Court process, and about a new
opportunity for youth in King County to resolve
criminal conflicts using Peacemaking Circles, rather
than the traditional Court system. To learn how you
can help, please join us, as well as speakers from both
the Courts and the Peacemaking Circles, for one of
three introductory information sessions in the Mother
Cabrini Room on the ground floor of the Pastoral

<p><b>WINTER SHELTER REQUEST</b>. Over the holidays, two
generous donors gifted new pillows for our Winter
Shelter. (Imagine sleeping without a pillow!) In order
to make our guests as comfortable as possible, we
would like to provide pillowcases with the pillows.

brought to Sunday Coffee Hour or to the Parish Office.
Thank you!</p>
<p><b>YOUTH MUSIC PROGRAM</b>. The spring semester of the
St. James Youth Music Program has begun! Do you
have a child who loves to sing or wants to learn?
Choral singing is not just about music - it builds social
skills, community, and cooperation in addition to
making music to the glory of God. The Schola
Cantorum choir, for girls and boys ages 8-13, provides
the music at the noon “First Sunday Youth
Celebrations,” the 5:30 Christmas Eve Vigil, and
various archepiscopal liturgies. Jubilate!, the
Cathedral's ensemble for young women of high school
age, sings regularly at the noon Mass on the third
Sunday of the month as well as various special liturgies
and occasional Vespers. This year, Jubilate! will sing
the Stabat Mater by Pergolesi, with orchestra at
the Good Friday Tre Ore service. New choristers are
requested to complete a short interview to assess
musical aptitude – to schedule an interview, please call
Youth Music Program director, Ms. Stacey Sunde at
206-941-9450. There is an $80 tuition fee assessed for
each child per semester, and financial aid scholarships
are available. Registration is ongoing throughout the
semester – for more information or to register online,

their responsibility to guide their children in the
practice of the faith, and to learn about the many ways
our parish supports families. Please allow at least two
months for preparation. <i>Information</i>,

week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Paul in
Seattle and on the Swinomish Reservation, and the Mission
