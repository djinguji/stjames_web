		<p><b>MINISTRY OF PRESENCE IN THE CATHEDRAL</b>.
The Year of Mercy has concluded, but the mercy
continues! Each weekday in the Cathedral, a
volunteer sits at a desk in the northeast corner of
the Cathedral near the Mary Shrine, available to
answer questions, accept prayer requests, and greet
visitors who stop in between 1:00pm-4:00pm. It’s
a quiet time to pray, read, and be present to those
who come to the Cathedral, often people in need.
If you’d like to spend one afternoon a week in the
Cathedral, we’d love to have you be a part of this
ministry. <i>Information</i>,

James Cathedral is a place of inclusion. We want
to know that everyone has access to accurate
information and has opportunity to share his or her
voice. By volunteering to provide occasional
interpreting to other parishioners, you can help to
build the wholeness and the holiness of our
community. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7</b>, this year marks the 75th
anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, that
hastened the United States' entry into World War
II. 2,403 Americans lost their lives on "a date which
will live in infamy," as President Franklin D.
Roosevelt declared on the following day. Let us
remember in prayer the victims of all wars, our
veterans and those currently serving in the military.</p>
<p><b>HUMAN RIGHTS DAY, DECEMBER 10</b>, commemorates
the adoption of the UN Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. Pope Francis reminds us that “human
rights are not only violated by terrorism, repression or
assassination, but also by unfair economic structures
that create huge inequalities.” May we have the
courage to stand in solidarity with those who are
denied their basic human rights. May we always
remember that to deny others their human rights is to
challenge their very humanity.</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES CATHEDRAL ON SOCIAL MEDIA</b>. Are you
among the more than 5,000 who follow St. James on Facebook? It’s a great way to stay abreast of current
events at the Cathedral. Find us at
<a target="_bulletin" href="http://www.facebook.com/stjamesseattle">www.facebook.com/stjamesseattle</a>. You can also find
us on Instagram at @stjamescathedral and on Twitter,
@StJamesSeattle.</p>
<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
week we remember in prayer the parishes of St. Andrew in
Sumner, St. Barbara in Black Diamond, and St. Francis
Xavier in Toledo.</p>
