<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. For more information about the parish, 
to register, or to ask a question, visit our <b>Sunday 
Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour. A Cathedral staff person 
will be on hand to assist you. Be sure to stop by the <b>Cathedral
Bookstore</b> after Mass for a wide selection of Cathedral
souvenirs as well as Catholic books and gifts.</i> </p>
<p><b>ON THE COVER</b>. During the month of November, when
we pray for our beloved dead, our bulletin covers
include the names of those who have left legacies large
and small to St. James Cathedral in their wills over the
past thirty years. Each year, bequests allow the
Cathedral to carry out its mission of prayer and service
here on First Hill.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered by Jeff and
Melissa Williams in memory of all deceased O’Dea
High School Alumni.</p>
<p><b>ALL SAINTS CHILDREN’S PROCESSION</b> at the
beginning of the Noon Mass. Parents, please
accompany very young children.</p>
<p><b>PARENTS’ FAITH FORMATION</b>. Yes, Mom and Dad,
these sessions are for YOU! They happen during the
time your children are in their CFF classes, and offer a chance learn about your 
Catholic faith, and share with other parents the struggles and joys of your 
faith life at home. The first series continues today, November 5, 11:05–11:40 in 
Room 206 of O’Dea High School.
<i>Information</i>:

<p><b>WORK ON THE CATHEDRAL TOWERS</b>. Work crews will
be on site for the next few weeks for a major repair and
restoration project on the upper levels of the Cathedral
towers. This will involve masonry and terra cotta
repairs and fixing some leaks. For the safety of the
workers, the bells will not be rung during the weekdays
that they are working. On a 100 + year old building,
these things need attention every few years!</p>

<p><b>SPECIAL NOTE FOR THOSE WHO WRITE CHECKS</b>. Our
bank has asked that all checks for Cathedral ministries
be made payable to S<span style="font-variant: small-caps">t</span>. J<span style="font-variant: small-caps"><font face="serif">ames</font></span>

		Dear Friends,<p>As we prepare for this year’s Sacrificial
Sunday Giving campaign, I wanted to give you a
heads-up about an important change to giving at
St. James Cathedral. We are switching this year
to a new provider for online giving, Our Sunday
Visitor. The new system will not only make life a
lot easier for our bookkeeper, it will make life
easier for you, as it will allow you to login to
your own account, check on your giving, input
changed credit cards, and more. You’ll even be
able to make your monthly gift to St. Vincent de
Paul using your credit card…!</p>
<p><b>In the coming week you will be receiving
an e-mail directly from Our Sunday Visitor
inviting you to set up an account. I hope you
will do so!</b></p>
<p>If you do not receive the e-mail, you will
still be able to set up an account by visiting the
Cathedral website and following the links
provided. Thank you!</p>

Annual General Meeting in
September. This year, we
sponsored a spirited debate
between Jenny Durkan and
Cary Moon, both of whom

questions posed by the HAC on their solutions for
homelessness and affordable housing, as well as their
position on the City’s sweeps of homeless
encampments. More than 200 people attended the
debate, where they engaged in what one candidate
called “the raucous exercise of their First Amendment
rights.” People from the SHARE/Nickelsville group
attended as well as many parishioners and other
interested citizens. Plans are already underway for next
year’s Annual Meeting. If you are interested in the
