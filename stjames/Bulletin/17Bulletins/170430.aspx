<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>You may recall that in a letter back in January, 2016, I shared with you that the
Archdiocese of Seattle and the Cathedral parish had entered into a long-term lease
arrangement with a developer who will build a 24-story senior housing facility on
property along Terry Avenue between Cherry and James Streets, property that is jointly
owned by the archdiocese and the parish. Construction is scheduled to begin late this
spring and will necessitate relocating the Solanus Casey Center, currently located on the
corner of Terry and James, to the Cathedral’s Gallagher Center on the lower level of the
Rectory along Columbia Street.</p>
<p>There is a definite plus side to this: by moving to the Cathedral campus, the
Solanus Casey Center will enjoy a greater visibility both for its clients as well as for you,
our parishioners. The plan is for the Center to open in its new location on June 1.</p>
<p>I am happy to take advantage of this new and promising development to bring the
important work of the Solanus Casey Center to your attention. Some of you, but not all,
know that the Center is named for Venerable Solanus Casey, a Capuchin priest who, for
many years, opened wide to the doors of his monastery in Detroit – providing a
welcoming presence and listening ear to all comers, especially the poor and needy.
Father Solanus happens to the great uncle of our own Sister Anne Herkenrath, and he is
on the path to being canonized by the Church. A partnership between the Cathedral and
Catholic Community Services, the Solanus Casey Center has been operating since 2005,
and has provided a warm welcome along with basic necessities (ID’s, gas vouchers, social
service referrals, etc.) for hundreds and hundreds of people in need.</p>
<p>The Center, under the able direction of Jonathan Prociv, is open from 1:00pm-4:00pm, Monday through Thursday. A wonderful group of committed volunteers are his
staff. They give one afternoon a week to the ministry.</p>
<p>As we prepare for this move, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the
Solanus Casey Center to your prayers and to ask you to consider getting involved in this
important – and, as our volunteers will tell you, extremely rewarding - ministry. The
move to the Gallagher Center will increase the need for additional volunteers so this is a
great opportunity to get involved. If you are interested in learning more about this,
please call Jonathan Prociv at 206-223-0907.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering this. And please join me in giving thanks to God for all
the good that is being done by the Solanus Casey Center!</p>
