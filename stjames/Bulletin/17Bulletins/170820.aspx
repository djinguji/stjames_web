<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a woman
who had just moved into housing for low-income seniors
after being homeless many years and spending the last
eight months in a shelter. She had no furniture so we
arranged to deliver a new bed and gave her a voucher so
she could buy a small sofa, kitchen table and chairs at a
local SVdP thrift store. We later spoke with her case
manager at Catholic Community Services and learned
that he, too, had promised her a SVdP store voucher.
Together, we laughed with great joy when we realized
that two Catholic charities had joined together to help
turn this woman’s new apartment into a true home. Your
donations to SVdP bring joy to those whose lives we are
able to change for the better – thank you! <i>Information</i>,

	<p><b>A WEEKLY TIP ON CARING FOR OUR COMMON HOME</b>.
“In the family we first learn how to show love and
respect for life; we are taught the proper use of things,
order and cleanliness, respect for the local ecosystem
and care for all creatures... In the family we learn to
ask without demanding, to say thank you as an
expression of genuine gratitude for what we have been
given, to control our aggressivity and greed, and to ask
forgiveness when we have caused harm. These simple
gestures… help to create a culture of shared life and
respect for our surroundings.” (<i>Laudato Si’</i>, 213)</p>
<p><b>FROM THE HOUSING ADVOCACY COMMITTEE</b>. This
year in Seattle and King County, as of January,

<ul>
	<li>11,643 people were experiencing homelessness;</li>
<li>55% were people of color;</li>

<p><b>CLIMATE SCIENCE, <i>LAUDATO SI’</i> & THE NORTHWEST:
A RESPONSE OF FAITH FOR THE FUTURE</b> Thursday,
September 14, 7:00-8:30pm Wyckoff Auditorium,
Seattle University. Jeff Renner, meteorologist at KING

Common Home.</p>
<p><b>CATHOLIC RELIEF SERVICES (CRS) IN AFGHANISTAN</b>.
It is with deep sadness that CRS announces the death
of three beloved colleagues and injuries to two other
staff in Afghanistan due to an assault on their vehicle.
The incident occurred on August 14, near Chaghcharan, the capital city of Ghor province, an
area once relatively peaceful but now home to active
Taliban and Islamic State militants. “We are shocked
and heartbroken over the loss of our colleagues in
Afghanistan,” CRS spokeswoman Megan Gilbert said
in a statement. “Our staff dedicate their lives to
helping others, and we will always be grateful for their
tremendous service to people in need.” “I call on all
parties to ensure that those providing humanitarian
assistance have safe access to the most vulnerable and
can carry out their lifesaving work unhindered,” U.N.
humanitarian coordinator in Afghanistan Richard
Peeperkorn said in a statement about the CRS attack.
CRS provides humanitarian aid to more than 200,000
Afghans, with a focus on agriculture, education, and
disaster response. Please keep these staff and their
families in your thoughts and prayers. This was written
from reports from CRS and Reuters.</p>
<p><b>CHURCH OF SECOND CHANCES: A FAITHFUL
EXPLORATION OF INCARCERATION</b>. Starting in
October, the Cathedral will be offering this 8-week
series developed by JustFaith Ministries. Together, we
will explore the Christian principle of restorative
justice, the critical need for comprehensive prison
reform, and a faith-based critique of the U.S. prison
system. By sharing the stories of incarcerated people
through interviews, documentaries, presentations by
experts, dialogue, and reflection, Church of Second
Chances widens the circle of connection. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>PARISH REMEMBRANCE</b>: <i>Throughout the year, because we
are the Cathedral Church, we remember in prayer at Mass
and Vespers each of the parishes and missions of the
Archdiocese of Seattle on a Sunday near their feast day</i>. This
