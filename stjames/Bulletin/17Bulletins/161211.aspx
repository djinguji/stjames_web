parish and find ways to meet fellow parishioners and
form community here? The best way to do that is by
getting involved in one of our many ministries!
<br>
		Here are some current opportunities.</i></p>

<p><b>CHRISTMAS GREETERS NEEDED</b>. Each year, about
two thousand parishioners and visitors join us for
the 10:00pm Mass on Christmas Eve. We need
your help to extend a warm welcome to every one
of them! Please consider volunteering as a greeter
to provide hospitality, answer basic questions, and
hand out programs. Greeters must arrive by
7:45pm—and they get reserved seats for the
Mass! Please contact
<a href="mailto:claughlin@stjames-cathedral.org?subject=Christmas Greeters">
Corinna Laughlin</a>, 206-264-2086, by Monday,
December 19 if interested.</p>
<p><b>LITURGICAL MINISTRIES</b>. Are you looking for a
way to get involved in the parish
community? Please consider a liturgical
ministry! We are especially in need of Ushers on
Sunday Evenings and Extraordinary Ministers of
Holy Communion on Saturday evenings at this
time. We always welcome new readers or altar
servers (children and adults) as well. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>OPERATION NIGHTWATCH VOLUNTEERS NEEDED</b>.
We are in need of volunteers to help prepare
sandwiches at Operation Nightwatch. Nightwatch is
a shelter for older members of the homeless
community that also serves free meals to people
living on the streets. St. James Cathedral is
responsible for making sandwiches at Nightwatch
on the First and Third Tuesday of each month. Our
sandwiches volunteers work from 5-7pm.

	<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a middle-aged grade school 
teacher who had to stop teaching because of medical issues. He applied for 
federal disability benefits two years ago, but his application is still pending. 
Meanwhile, his temporary state disability benefits ran out, and his repeated 
efforts to earn money have produced little more than “enough for an occasional 
hamburger.” We helped pay his rent, referred him to other possible sources of 
rent help, jobs and legal help to assist with the federal benefits application. 
Your generous support made all this possible – thank you! <i>Information</i>,
