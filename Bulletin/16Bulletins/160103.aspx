<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our <b>Sunday Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

Cathedral.</p>
<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL SOCIETY THANKS YOU</b>. An elderly
man called the SVdP Helpline and said he only had a loaf
of bread and was hungry. We visited that night and
learned he had just moved into his small apartment after
being homeless 12 years. He was very excited to show us
his new home. When we left, he was heading to the
grocery store to spend our food voucher, announcing that
the next morning he would cook himself bacon and eggs
for the first time in a very long time – thank you for
helping this man make a fresh start! <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>WELCOME BACK!</b> Have you drifted away from your
Catholic faith? Are you disillusioned by what you hear
about the church? Do you desire a life filled with faith?
St. James Cathedral offers a 9-week program for
Catholics out of touch with a Church that once may
have been home. It’s a safe place to ask questions, and
to experience a small community of faith. Winter
session begins Monday, January 11, and continues
Mondays through March. Sessions are 7:00 – 9:00 pm
in Cathedral Place. <i>Information</i>:

participate in the RCIA, a process of initiation into the
Catholic Church. You can learn more by going to

<p><b>BAPTISM OF INFANTS & YOUNG CHILDREN</b> (under the

Masses. To prepare for this most important sacrament,
parents and godparents participate in a series of classes

their responsibility to guide their children in the practice
of the faith, and to learn about the many ways our parish
supports families. Please allow at least two months for
preparation. <i>Information</i>,
