<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>You may have noticed an announcement in the bulletin last weekend that St.
James Cathedral has been invited to participate in a national survey on parish life and
spiritual growth. The survey, the Disciple Maker Index, is conducted annually by the
highly respected consulting firm, the Catholic Leadership Institute.</p>
<p>Our parish, along with a number of other parishes in area, is participating in
this survey as part of a comprehensive long-term planning project for our parishes,
particularly with regard to such issues as a shortage of priests, the possible need to
close or consolidate parishes, and the potential for involving more lay ministers in
parish leadership.</p>
<p>You might be thinking, “Didn’t we just do a survey?” And you would be
correct! However, that survey, conducted in September (the results of which are now
available on the parish website), was for our parish alone, and was conducted to help
us develop a five year plan for the parish.</p>
<p>The Disciple Maker Index asks similar questions, but is significantly more
detailed. The results of the survey will help form a picture of the entire Church in
Western Washington, and will help determine how the parishes in South Seattle are
going to address the challenges that face us in the years ahead.</p>
<p>This is an important exercise and I encourage you to take a few minutes to
participate in it. I know that Archbishop Sartain will be grateful for your participation
and so will I. And there will be other opportunities for your further input as this
important planning process unfolds.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for participating, and may you know God’s blessings in
abundance during this Year of Mercy.</p>

<p><i>P.S. The Disciple Maker Index is primarily an on-line survey. In the coming week, a link will
be sent to all parishioners for whom we have an e-mail address. (Look for an e-mail from

on file, you can simply visit the Cathedral website where a
