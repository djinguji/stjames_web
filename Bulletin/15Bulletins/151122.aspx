<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our <b>Sunday Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered by Dick and
Bridget Cooley.</p>
<p><b>NO EVENING MASS ON MONDAY, NOVEMBER 23</b>. This
coming Monday at 5:00pm, we will be hosting the
funeral Mass for Sue Mecham, longtime Managing
Director of the Fulcrum Foundation. Because of this,
there will be no 5:30pm Mass on Monday evening.
Parishioners are welcome to attend the funeral Mass.</p>
<p><b>MASS OF THANKSGIVING DAY</b>. On Thursday, November
26 at 9:30am, we will have our annual Thanksgiving
Day Mass, during which all are invited to bring forward
non-perishable food items to be shared with the poor and
needy in our neighborhood. What better way to begin
our national feast of Thanksgiving than by celebrating
the Eucharist as a parish family?</p>
<p><b>ADVENT FAIR TRADE BAZAAR</b>. On Sunday morning,
November 29, after the 8am, 10am, and Noon Masses,
we have an opportunity to get started on our Christmas
shopping while supporting a number of great causes! L’Arche, Catholic Relief Services, our own Youth
Ministry, the Association of Catholic Childhood, the
Cathedral Bookstore and others will be offering
handmade items.</p>
<p><b>COLLEGE STUDENT SUPPORT GROUP</b>. Did you know
that 40% of all college students do not seek support
when feeling overwhelmed or experiencing depression,
anxiety, eating disorders, addiction or thoughts of
suicide? Non-traditional students like veterans, parents,
immigrants, those living with a mental health condition
or other complex situations may have even greater
challenges. Join psychology doctoral candidate Andrea
Salazar for Pizza and Problem Solving on Sunday,
December 6, 3:00-4:30pm in the Fireside Room,
Pastoral Outreach Center. The group will gather
monthly. RSVP to

<p><b>YOUTH NIGHTS</b>. This week, FATHER RYAN will
offer a tour of the Cathedral attic! How cool! Plus,
we’ll engage in a festive holiday party complete
with gift tag making for the Migrant Toy & Coat
Drive. You don’t want to miss this! Youth Nights
occur on Sunday evenings from 6:30–8:30pm in the
Pastoral Outreach Center. Open to all 8th-12th
grade students.</p>
<p><b>MIGRANT TOY & WINTER COAT DRIVE</b>. We will
once again be collecting toys and winter coats for
migrant children in the Skagit Valley. We will
include gift tags on this year’s parish Giving Tree.
Please consider taking a tag and contributing to the
effort!</p>
<p><b>ADVENT FAIR ROSARY FUNDRAISER</b>. The
Cathedral will be sending a delegation of youth to
World Youth Day in Poland with Pope Francis this
summer! You can help us get there! Youth ministry
participants will be selling handmade, Fair Trade
Nicaraguan rosaries at the parish Advent Fair on
Sunday, November 29. Please consider purchasing
a rosary and supporting our youth!</p>

<p><b>MUSIC FOR THE FEAST OF ST. NICHOLAS</b>. On Sunday,
December 6 at 7:30pm, don't miss resident ensemble
Opus 7’s celebration of the Feast of St. Nicholas with
Benjamin Britten’s brilliantly entertaining and moving
cantata, <i>Saint Nicolas</i>. This joyous cantata for choir,
orchestra, tenor soloist, and children's choirs will
feature young singers from St. James’ own Youth
Music Program (Stacey Sunde, director) and Dr. Paul

<p><b>NIGHTWATCH SEEKS VOLUNTEER</b>. The St. James
Cathedral team at Operation Nightwatch needs a
volunteer to help serve a late dinner to people
experiencing homelessness on the third Tuesday of the
month, 8:30pm-10:30pm, at 302 14th Ave S. The
volunteer must be willing to commit for at least 6
months. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL SOCIETY THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a man who had just 
moved into an apartment after being homeless several years. After paying rent, 
he had little left to live on. He had almost no clothes or other personal 
belongings, including precious family mementoes, because they were in a storage 
unit about to be auctioned off for nonpayment of storage fees. With your 
support, we paid part of the bill and persuaded the storage company to delay the 
auction long enough for the man to pay the rest himself – thank you!
