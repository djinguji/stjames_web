<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our “Welcome Table” at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

in memory of his mother, Irene Telmo.</p>
<p><b>ST. JAMES KNITTERS GROUP</b> meets November 9 from

Deceased Homeless November 12. If you've been
working on a project, this is the time to bring it in.

Day Mass, during which all are invited to bring forward
non-perishable food items to be shared with the poor and
needy in our neighborhood. What better way to begin
our national feast of Thanksgiving than by celebrating
the Eucharist as a parish family?</p>

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL SOCIETY THANKS YOU</b>. We were
running late on an evening of home visits. When we
reached our last stop, the woman we met exclaimed
with joy that she had just gotten down on her hands and
knees and prayed that we had not forgotten her. Just as
she finished her prayer, we knocked on her door! We
provided food help, but what she needed most was our
visit – a few minutes of friendly caring and sharing to
relieve her loneliness and offer hope. Your support
helps us deliver God’s gift of love – thank you!
