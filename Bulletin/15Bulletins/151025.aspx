<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our “Welcome Table” at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>

Mass with the Cathedral Choir, Cathedral Chamber

<p><b>REPORT FROM ST VINCENT DE PAUL</b>. Your donations
to SVdP allowed our Cathedral Vincentians to make

help 205 low (or no) income residents of the Cathedral
Parish who struggle to pay for life's necessities, such as
rent, electricity, beds, food, clothes and basic hygiene
products. That's an average of about 49 home visits and
68 people helped per month. Even more parish residents
seek our assistance, but we will need more dollars and
more volunteers to make that possible. Please help, if
you can! <i>Information</i>,

second year of abundant harvest, it’s now time to shut
down the garden for the winter. A work party and
potluck is scheduled for Saturday, November 14,

success. You’re welcome to come to either or both of
