<p><b>WELCOME!</b> <i>If you are a visitor to the
Cathedral, we want you to know how
welcome you are – whether you have come
from another part of the country, from across the
world, or simply from another parish here in the
Archdiocese. Thanks, in part, to the generosity of
visitors like you, we are able to celebrate the Church’s
liturgy here in a fitting and beautiful way. We are also
able to offer a wide range of services to needy people
living in the central district of our city. For more
information about the parish, to register, or to ask a
question, visit our <b>Sunday Help Desk</b> at Coffee Hour.
A Cathedral staff person will be on hand to assist you.</i> </p>
<p><b>COVER ART</b> Detail of the Ceremonial Bronze Doors,
Ulrich Henn, artist.</p>
<p><b>FLOWERS AT THE ALTAR</b> are offered in memory of Mairead Corrigan from her loving family.</p>
<p><b>WANT TO GET MORE INVOLVED AT ST. JAMES?</b> Come
visit the Sunday Help Desk at Coffee Hour! Here, you
can register as a parishioner, find out how to volunteer
for a ministry, arrange to have a Mass offered, and
discover more about this community.</p>
<p><b>YEAR OF MERCY</b>. We welcome all pilgrims to St. James
Cathedral during this Year of Mercy. Whether you are a
visitor or a regular at St. James, you can walk through the
Holy Doors of Mercy, the four bronze doors at the
Cathedral’s west entrance. The center doors are opened
before and after each Mass. A self-guided pilgrimage of
prayer, <i>The Way of Mercy</i>, is available as well—pick up
a flyer just inside the Holy Doors. Find out more at
<a href="http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/mercy/default.aspx">the parish website</a>.</p>
<p><b>NORTHWEST CATHOLIC COLLECTION</b>. This weekend,
you’ll find envelopes in the pew racks for the Northwest
Catholic, the magazine sent to every registered Catholic
household in western Washington. Your donations make
this outreach possible!</p>
<p><b>IDENTITY AND CRISIS: SYRIA AND BEYOND</b>. The war in
Syria has killed as many as 250,000 Syrians and has
uprooted more than 11 million people. The European
refugee crisis, international terrorism, and the role of the
Christian church in the Middle East are all intertwined
in the history, politics and culture of Syria. Fr. David Nazar, SJ, will speak on the situation in Syria that has
given rise to the conflict and the refugee crisis, as well
as the response of the church to the crisis. Fr. Nazar has
been the Provincial Superior of the Jesuits in Canada
and in Ukraine, and is currently the Rector of the
Pontifical Orientale Institute in Rome. Monday, January
25, 7:00 pm, Pastoral Outreach Center. <i>Information</i>,

<p><b>ST VINCENT DE PAUL THANKS YOU</b>. We visited a young
couple who recently moved to Seattle. He landed a good
job and she enrolled in college. His employer soon
downsized and, as “last hired,” he was “first fired.”
Without his income, she could not afford tuition and
had to drop out of college. Then their savings ran out.
They could not pay rent and faced eviction. With your
support, we were able to help pay their rent to keep a
roof over their heads until they could both find new jobs
– thank you!</p>
