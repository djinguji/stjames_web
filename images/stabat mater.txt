At the cross her station keeping, 
Mary stood in sorrow weeping 
When her Son was crucified. 

While she waited in her anguish, 
Seeing Christ in torment languish, 
Bitter sorrow pierced her heart. 

With what pain and desolation, 
With what noble resignation, 
Mary watched her dying Son. 

Ever-patient in her yearning 
Though her tear-filled eyes were burning, 
Mary gazed upon her Son. 

Who, that sorrow contemplating, 
On that passion meditating, 
Would not share the Virgin's grief? 

Christ she saw, for our salvation, 
Scourged with cruel acclamation, 
Bruised and beaten by the rod. 

Christ she saw with life-blood failing, 
All her anguish unavailing, 
Saw him breathe his very last. 

Mary, fount of love's devotion, 
Let me share with true emotion 
All the sorrow you endured. 

Virgin, ever interceding, 
Hear me in my fervent pleading: 
Fire me with your love of Christ. 

Mother, may this prayer be granted:
That Christ's love may be implanted
In the depths of my poor soul.

At the cross, your sorrow sharing, 
All your grief and torment bearing, 
Let me stand and mourn with you. 

Fairest maid of all creation, 
Queen of hope and consolation, 
Let me feel your grief sublime. 

Virgin, in your love befriend me, 
At the Judgment Day defend me. 
Help me by your constant prayer. 

Savior, when my life shall leave me,
Through your mother's prayers receive me
With the fruits of victory. 

Virgin of all virgins blest! 
Listen to my fond request: 
Let me share your grief divine 

Let me, to my latest breath, 
In my body bear the death 
Of your dying Son divine. 

Wounded with His every wound, 
Steep my soul till it has swooned 
In His very Blood away. 

Be to me, O Virgin, nigh, 
Lest in flames I burn and die, 
In His awe-full judgment day. 

Savior, when my life shall leave me,
Through your mother's prayers receive me
With the fruits of victory. 

While my body here decays 
May my soul your goodness praise, 
Safe in heaven eternally. Amen Alleluia.
